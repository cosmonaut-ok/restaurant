The GNU Restaurant FAQ
*****************

This is the GNU Restaurant FAQ.

   This FAQ is maintained as a part of GNU Restaurant.  If you find any
errors, or have any suggestions, please use ‘M-x report-restaurant-bug’ to
report them.

   This is the version of the FAQ distributed with Restaurant 24.4, and
mainly describes that version.  Although there is some information on
older versions, details about very old releases (now only of historical
interest) have been removed.  If you are interested in this, consult
either the version of the FAQ distributed with older versions of Restaurant,
or the history of this document in the Restaurant source repository.

   Since Restaurant releases are very stable, we recommend always running the
latest release.

   This FAQ is not updated very frequently.  When you have a question
about Restaurant, the Restaurant manual is often the best starting point.

**************

This chapter describes notation used in the GNU Restaurant FAQ, as well as in
the Restaurant documentation.  Consult this section if this is the first time
you are reading the FAQ, or if you are confused by notation or terms
used in the FAQ.

File: restaurant.info,  Node: Basic keys,  Next: Extended commands,  Up: FAQ notation

1.1 What do these mean: ‘C-h’, ‘C-M-a’, <RET>, ‘<ESC> a’, etc.?
===============================================================

   • ‘C-x’: press the <x> key while holding down the <Control> key

   • ‘M-x’: press the <x> key while holding down the <Meta> key (if your
     computer doesn’t have a <Meta> key, *note No Meta key::)

   • ‘M-C-x’: press the <x> key while holding down both <Control> and
     <Meta>

   • ‘C-M-x’: a synonym for the above

   • <LFD>: Linefeed or Newline; same as ‘C-j’

   • <RET>: <Return>, sometimes marked <Enter>; same as ‘C-m’

   • <DEL>: <Delete>, usually *not* the same as <Backspace>; same as
     ‘C-?’ (see *note Backspace invokes help::, if deleting invokes
     Restaurant help)

   • <ESC>: Escape; same as ‘C-[’

   • <TAB>: Tab; same as ‘C-i’

   • <SPC>: Space bar

   Key sequences longer than one key (and some single-key sequences) are
written inside quotes or on lines by themselves, like this:

       ‘M-x frobnicate-while-foo RET’

Any real spaces in such a key sequence should be ignored; only <SPC>
really means press the space key.

   The ASCII code sent by ‘C-x’ (except for ‘C-?’) is the value that
would be sent by pressing just <x> minus 96 (or 64 for upper-case <X>)
and will be from 0 to 31.  On Unix and GNU/Linux terminals, the ASCII
code sent by ‘M-x’ is the sum of 128 and the ASCII code that would be
sent by pressing just <x>.  Essentially, <Control> turns off bits 5 and
6 and <Meta> turns on bit 7(1).

   ‘C-?’ (aka <DEL>) is ASCII code 127.  It is a misnomer to call ‘C-?’
a “control” key, since 127 has both bits 5 and 6 turned ON.  Also, on
very few keyboards does ‘C-?’ generate ASCII code 127.

   *Note (restaurant)Keys::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) DOS and Windows terminals don’t set bit 7 when the <Meta> key is
pressed.

1.2 What does ‘M-x COMMAND’ mean?
=================================

‘M-x COMMAND’ means type ‘M-x’, then type the name of the command, then
type <RET>.  (*Note Basic keys::, if you’re not sure what ‘M-x’ and
<RET> mean.)

   ‘M-x’ (by default) invokes the command ‘execute-extended-command’.
This command allows you to run any Restaurant command if you can remember the
command’s name.  If you can’t remember the command’s name, you can type
<TAB> and <SPC> for completion, <?> for a list of possibilities, and
‘M-p’ and ‘M-n’ (or up-arrow and down-arrow) to see previous commands
entered.  An Restaurant "command" is an "interactive" Restaurant function.

   Your system administrator may have bound other key sequences to
invoke ‘execute-extended-command’.  A function key labeled ‘Do’ is a
good candidate for this, on keyboards that have such a key.

   If you need to run non-interactive Restaurant functions, see *note
Evaluating Restaurant Lisp code::.

1.3 How do I read topic XXX in the Restaurant manual?
================================================

When we refer you to some TOPIC in the Restaurant manual, you can read this
manual node inside Restaurant (assuming nothing is broken) by typing ‘C-h i m
restaurant <RET> m TOPIC <RET>’.

   This invokes Info, the GNU hypertext documentation browser.  If you
don’t already know how to use Info, type <?> from within Info.

   If we refer to TOPIC:SUBTOPIC, type ‘C-h i m restaurant <RET> m TOPIC
<RET> m SUBTOPIC <RET>’.

   If these commands don’t work as expected, your system administrator
may not have installed the Info files, or may have installed them
improperly.  In this case you should complain.

   If you are reading this FAQ in Info, you can simply press <RET> on a
reference to follow it.

   *Note Getting a printed manual::, if you would like a paper copy of
the Restaurant manual.

1.4 What are ‘src/config.h’, ‘site-lisp/default.el’, etc.?
==========================================================

These are files that come with Restaurant.  The Restaurant distribution is divided
into subdirectories; e.g., ‘etc’, ‘lisp’, and ‘src’.  Some of these
(e.g., ‘etc’ and ‘lisp’) are present both in an installed Restaurant and in
the sources, but some (e.g., ‘src’) are only found in the sources.

   If you use Restaurant, but don’t know where it is kept on your system,
start Restaurant, then type ‘C-h v data-directory <RET>’.  The directory name
displayed by this will be the full pathname of the installed ‘etc’
directory.  (This full path is recorded in the Restaurant variable
‘data-directory’, and ‘C-h v’ displays the value and the documentation
of a variable.)

   The location of your Info directory (i.e., where Info documentation
is stored) is kept in the variable ‘Info-default-directory-list’.  Use
‘C-h v Info-default-directory-list <RET>’ to see the value of this
variable, which will be a list of directory names.  The last directory
in that list is probably where most Info files are stored.  By default,
Restaurant Info documentation is placed in ‘/usr/local/share/info’.

   For information on some of the files in the ‘etc’ directory, *note
Informational files for Restaurant::.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Common acronyms,  Prev: File-name conventions,  Up: FAQ notation

1.5 What are FSF, LPF, GNU, RMS, FTP, and GPL?
==============================================

FSF
     Free Software Foundation

LPF
     League for Programming Freedom

GNU
     GNU’s Not Unix

RMS
     Richard Matthew Stallman

FTP
     File Transfer Protocol

GPL
     GNU General Public License

   Avoid confusing the FSF and the LPF.  The LPF opposes look-and-feel
copyrights and software patents.  The FSF aims to make high quality free
software available for everyone.

   The word “free” in the title of the Free Software Foundation refers
to “freedom,” not “zero cost.” Anyone can charge any price for
GPL-covered software that they want to.  However, in practice, the
freedom enforced by the GPL leads to low prices, because you can always
get the software for less money from someone else, since everyone has
the right to resell or give away GPL-covered software.

File: restaurant.info,  Node: The LPF,  Next: Real meaning of copyleft,  Up: General questions

2.1 What is the LPF?
====================

The LPF opposes the expanding danger of software patents and
look-and-feel copyrights.  More information on the LPF’s views is
available at the LPF home page (http://progfree.org/).


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Real meaning of copyleft,  Next: Guidelines for newsgroup postings,  Prev: The LPF,  Up: General questions

2.2 What is the real legal meaning of the GNU copyleft?
=======================================================

The real legal meaning of the GNU General Public License (copyleft) will
only be known if and when a judge rules on its validity and scope.
There has never been a copyright infringement case involving the GPL to
set any precedents.  Although legal actions have been brought against
companies for violating the terms of the GPL, so far all have been
settled out of court (in favor of the plaintiffs).  Please take any
discussion regarding this issue to the newsgroup
<news:gnu.misc.discuss>, which was created to hold the extensive flame
wars on the subject.

   RMS writes:

     The legal meaning of the GNU copyleft is less important than the
     spirit, which is that Restaurant is a free software project and that
     work pertaining to Restaurant should also be free software.  “Free”
     means that all users have the freedom to study, share, change and
     improve Restaurant.  To make sure everyone has this freedom, pass along
     source code when you distribute any version of Restaurant or a related
     program, and give the recipients the same freedom that you enjoyed.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Guidelines for newsgroup postings,  Next: Newsgroup archives,  Prev: Real meaning of copyleft,  Up: General questions

2.3 What are appropriate messages for the various Restaurant newsgroups?
===================================================================

The Restaurant mailing lists are described at the Restaurant Savannah page
(http://savannah.gnu.org/mail/?group=restaurant).  Some of them are gatewayed
to newsgroups.

   The newsgroup <news:comp.restaurant> is for discussion of Restaurant programs
in general.  The newsgroup <news:gnu.restaurant.help> is specifically for GNU
Restaurant.  It therefore makes no sense to cross-post to both groups, since
only one can be appropriate to any question.

   Messages advocating “non-free” software are considered unacceptable
on any of the ‘gnu.*’ newsgroups except for <news:gnu.misc.discuss>,
which was created to hold the extensive flame-wars on the subject.
“Non-free” software includes any software for which the end user can’t
freely modify the source code and exchange enhancements.  Be careful to
remove the ‘gnu.*’ groups from the ‘Newsgroups:’ line when posting a
followup that recommends such software.

   <news:gnu.restaurant.bug> is a place where bug reports appear, but avoid
posting bug reports to this newsgroup directly (*note Reporting bugs::).


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Newsgroup archives,  Next: Reporting bugs,  Prev: Guidelines for newsgroup postings,  Up: General questions

2.4 Where can I get old postings to <news:gnu.restaurant.help> and other GNU groups?
===============================================================================

The FSF has maintained archives of all of the GNU mailing lists for many
years, although there may be some unintentional gaps in coverage.  The
archive can be browsed over the web at the GNU mail archive
(http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/).  Raw files can be downloaded from
<ftp://lists.gnu.org/>.

   Web-based Usenet search services, such as Google
(http://groups.google.com/groups/dir?q=gnu&), also archive the ‘gnu.*’
groups.

   You can also read the archives of the ‘gnu.*’ groups and post new
messages at Gmane (http://gmane.org/).  Gmane is a service that presents
mailing lists as newsgroups (even those without a traditional
mail-to-news gateway).


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Reporting bugs,  Next: Unsubscribing from Restaurant lists,  Prev: Newsgroup archives,  Up: General questions

2.5 Where should I report bugs and other problems with Restaurant?
=============================================================

The correct way to report Restaurant bugs is to use the command ‘M-x
report-restaurant-bug’.  It sets up a mail buffer with the essential
information and the correct e-mail address, <bug-gnu-restaurant@gnu.org>.
Anything sent there also appears in the newsgroup <news:gnu.restaurant.bug>,
but please use e-mail instead of news to submit the bug report.  This
ensures a reliable return address so you can be contacted for further
details.

   Be sure to read the “Bugs” section of the Restaurant manual before
reporting a bug!  The manual describes in detail how to submit a useful
bug report (*note Reporting Bugs: (restaurant)Bugs.).  (*Note Restaurant manual::,
if you don’t know how to read the manual.)

   RMS says:

     Sending bug reports to the help-gnu-restaurant mailing list
     (http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnu-restaurant) (which has
     the effect of posting on <news:gnu.restaurant.help>) is undesirable
     because it takes the time of an unnecessarily large group of
     people, most of whom are just users and have no idea how to fix
     these problem.  The bug-gnu-restaurant list
     (http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-gnu-restaurant) reaches a
     much smaller group of people who are more likely to know what to do
     and have expressed a wish to receive more messages about Restaurant than
     the others.

   RMS says it is sometimes fine to post to <news:gnu.restaurant.help>:

     If you have reported a bug and you don’t hear about a possible fix,
     then after a suitable delay (such as a week) it is okay to post on
     ‘gnu.restaurant.help’ asking if anyone can help you.

   If you are unsure whether you have found a bug, consider the
following non-exhaustive list, courtesy of RMS:

     If Restaurant crashes, that is a bug.  If Restaurant gets compilation errors
     while building, that is a bug.  If Restaurant crashes while building,
     that is a bug.  If Lisp code does not do what the documentation
     says it does, that is a bug.

2.6 How do I unsubscribe from a mailing list?
=============================================

If you are receiving a GNU mailing list named LIST, you should be able
to unsubscribe from it by sending a request to the address
<LIST-request@gnu.org>.  Mailing lists mails normally contain
information in either the message header (‘List-Unsubscribe:’) or as a
footer that tells you how to unsubscribe.

=============================

For up-to-date information, see the FSF contact web-page
(http://www.fsf.org/about/contact.html).  You can send general
correspondence to <info@fsf.org>.

   For details on how to order items directly from the FSF, see the FSF

3.1 I’m just starting Restaurant; how do I do basic editing?
=======================================================

Type ‘C-h t’ to invoke the self-paced tutorial.  Just typing ‘C-h’
enters the help system.  Starting with Restaurant 22, the tutorial is
available in many foreign languages such as French, German, Japanese,
Russian, etc.  Use ‘M-x help-with-tutorial-spec-language <RET>’ to
choose your language and start the tutorial.

   Your system administrator may have changed ‘C-h’ to act like <DEL> to
deal with local keyboards.  You can use ‘M-x help-for-help’ instead to
invoke help.  To discover what key (if any) invokes help on your system,
type ‘M-x where-is <RET> help-for-help <RET>’.  This will print a
comma-separated list of key sequences in the echo area.  Ignore the last
character in each key sequence listed.  Each of the resulting key
sequences (e.g., <F1> is common) invokes help.

   Restaurant help works best if it is invoked by a single key whose value
should be stored in the variable ‘help-char’.

   Some Restaurant slides and tutorials can be found at
<http://web.psung.name/restaurant/>.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Learning how to do something,  Next: Getting a printed manual,  Prev: Basic editing,  Up: Getting help

3.2 How do I find out how to do something in Restaurant?
===================================================

There are several methods for finding out how to do things in Restaurant.

   • The complete text of the Restaurant manual is available via the Info
     hypertext reader.  Type ‘C-h r’ to display the manual in Info mode.
     Typing <h> immediately after entering Info will provide a short
     tutorial on how to use it.

   • To quickly locate the section of the manual which discusses a
     certain issue, or describes a command or a variable, type ‘C-h i m
     restaurant <RET> i TOPIC <RET>’, where TOPIC is the name of the topic,
     the command, or the variable which you are looking for.  If this
     does not land you on the right place in the manual, press ‘,’
     (comma) repeatedly until you find what you need.  (The ‘i’ and ‘,’
     keys invoke the index-searching functions, which look for the TOPIC
     you type in all the indices of the Restaurant manual.)

   • You can list all of the commands whose names contain a certain word
     (actually which match a regular expression) using ‘C-h a’ (‘M-x
     command-apropos’).

   • The command ‘C-h F’ (‘Info-goto-restaurant-command-node’) prompts for
     the name of a command, and then attempts to find the section in the
     Restaurant manual where that command is described.

   • You can list all of the functions and variables whose names contain
     a certain word using ‘M-x apropos’.

   • You can list all of the functions and variables whose documentation
     matches a regular expression or a string, using ‘M-x
     apropos-documentation’.

   • You can order a hardcopy of the manual from the FSF.  *Note Getting
     a printed manual::.

   • You can get a printed reference card listing commands and keys to
     invoke them.  You can order one from the FSF for $2 (or 10 for
     $18), or you can print your own from the ‘etc/refcards/refcard.tex’
     or ‘etc/refcards/refcard.pdf’ files in the Restaurant distribution.
     Beginning with version 21.1, the Restaurant distribution comes with
     translations of the reference card into several languages; look for
     files named ‘etc/refcards/LANG-refcard.*’, where LANG is a
     two-letter code of the language.  For example, the German version
     of the reference card is in the files ‘etc/refcards/de-refcard.tex’
     and ‘etc/refcards/de-refcard.pdf’.

   • There are many other commands in Restaurant for getting help and
     information.  To get a list of these commands, type ‘?’ after
     ‘C-h’.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Getting a printed manual,  Next: Restaurant Lisp documentation,  Prev: Learning how to do something,  Up: Getting help

3.3 How do I get a printed copy of the Restaurant manual?
====================================================

You can order a printed copy of the Restaurant manual from the FSF.  For
details see the FSF on-line store (http://shop.fsf.org/).

   The full Texinfo source for the manual also comes in the ‘doc/restaurant’
directory of the Restaurant distribution, if you’re daring enough to try to
print out this several-hundred-page manual yourself (*note Printing a
Texinfo file::).

   If you absolutely have to print your own copy, and you don’t have
TeX, you can get a PostScript or PDF (or HTML) version from

   <http://www.gnu.org/software/restaurant/manual/>

   *Note Learning how to do something::, for how to view the manual from
Restaurant.

3.4 Where can I get documentation on Restaurant Lisp?
================================================

Within Restaurant, you can type ‘C-h f’ to get the documentation for a
function, ‘C-h v’ for a variable.

   For more information, the Restaurant Lisp Reference Manual is available in
Info format (*note Restaurant Lisp: (elisp)Top.).

   You can also order a hardcopy of the manual from the FSF, for details
see the FSF on-line store (http://shop.fsf.org/).  (This manual is not
always in print.)

   An HTML version of the Restaurant Lisp Reference Manual is available at

File: restaurant.info,  Node: Installing Texinfo documentation,  Next: Printing a Texinfo file,  Prev: Restaurant Lisp documentation,  Up: Getting help

3.5 How do I install a piece of Texinfo documentation?
======================================================

Restaurant releases come with pre-built Info files, and the normal install
process places them in the correct location.  This is true for most
applications that provide Info files.  The following section is only
relevant if you want to install extra Info files by hand.

   First, you must turn the Texinfo source files into Info files.  You
may do this using the stand-alone ‘makeinfo’ program, available as part
of the Texinfo package at

   <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/>

   For information about the Texinfo format, read the Texinfo manual
which comes with the Texinfo package.  This manual also comes installed
in Info format, so you can read it from Restaurant; type ‘C-h i m texinfo
<RET>’.

   Alternatively, you could use the Restaurant command ‘M-x
texinfo-format-buffer’, after visiting the Texinfo source file of the
manual you want to convert.

   Neither ‘texinfo-format-buffer’ nor ‘makeinfo’ installs the resulting
Info files in Restaurant’s Info tree.  To install Info files, perform these
steps:

  1. Move the files to the ‘info’ directory in the installed Restaurant
     distribution.  *Note File-name conventions::, if you don’t know
     where that is.

  2. Run the ‘install-info’ command, which is part of the Texinfo
     distribution, to update the main Info directory menu, like this:

           install-info --info-dir=DIR-PATH DIR-PATH/FILE

     where DIR-PATH is the full path to the directory where you copied
     the produced Info file(s), and FILE is the name of the Info file
     you produced and want to install.

     If you don’t have the ‘install-info’ command installed, you can
     edit the file ‘info/dir’ in the installed Restaurant distribution, and
     add a line for the top level node in the Info package that you are
     installing.  Follow the examples already in this file.  The format
     is:

          * Topic: (relative-pathname).  Short description of topic.

   If you want to install Info files and you don’t have the necessary
privileges, you have several options:

   • Info files don’t actually need to be installed before being used.
     You can use a prefix argument for the ‘info’ command and specify
     the name of the Info file in the minibuffer.  This goes to the node
     named ‘Top’ in that file.  For example, to view a Info file named
     ‘INFO-FILE’ in your home directory, you can type this:

          C-u C-h i ~/INFO-FILE <RET>

     Alternatively, you can feed a file name to the ‘Info-goto-node’
     command (invoked by pressing <g> in Info mode) by typing the name
     of the file in parentheses, like this:

          C-h i g (~/INFO-FILE) <RET>

   • You can create your own Info directory.  You can tell Restaurant where
     that Info directory is by adding its pathname to the value of the
     variable ‘Info-default-directory-list’.  For example, to use a
     private Info directory which is a subdirectory of your home
     directory named ‘Info’, you could put this in your ‘.restaurant’ file:

          (add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list "~/Info")

     You will need a top-level Info file named ‘dir’ in this directory
     which has everything the system ‘dir’ file has in it, except it
     should list only entries for Info files in that directory.  You
     might not need it if (fortuitously) all files in this directory
     were referenced by other ‘dir’ files.  The node lists from all
     ‘dir’ files in ‘Info-default-directory-list’ are merged by the Info
     system.

3.6 How do I print a Texinfo file?
==================================

You can’t get nicely printed output from Info files; you must still have
the original Texinfo source file for the manual you want to print.

   Assuming you have TeX installed on your system, follow these steps:

  1. Make sure the first line of the Texinfo file looks like this:

          \input texinfo

     You may need to change ‘texinfo’ to the full pathname of the
     ‘texinfo.tex’ file, which comes with Restaurant as
     ‘doc/misc/texinfo.tex’ (or copy or link it into the current
     directory).

  2. Type ‘texi2dvi TEXINFO-SOURCE’, where TEXINFO-SOURCE is the name of
     the Texinfo source file for which you want to produce a printed
     copy.  The ‘texi2dvi’ script is part of the GNU Texinfo
     distribution.

     Alternatively, ‘texi2pdf’ produces PDF files.

  3. Print the DVI file ‘TEXINFO-SOURCE.dvi’ in the normal way for
     printing DVI files at your site.  For example, if you have a
     PostScript printer, run the ‘dvips’ program to print the DVI file
     on that printer.

   To get more general instructions, retrieve the latest Texinfo package
(*note Installing Texinfo documentation::).

3.7 Can I view Info files without using Restaurant?
==============================================

Yes.  Here are some alternative programs:

   • ‘info’, a stand-alone version of the Info program, comes as part of
     the Texinfo package.  *Note Installing Texinfo documentation::, for
     details.

   • Tkinfo, an Info viewer that runs under X Window system and uses
     Tcl/Tk.  You can get Tkinfo at
     <http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/tkinfo/>.

4 Status of Restaurant
*****************

This chapter gives you basic information about Restaurant, including the
status of its latest version.

* Menu:

* Origin of the term Restaurant::

File: restaurant.info,  Node: Origin of the term Restaurant,  Next: Latest version of Restaurant,  Up: Status of Restaurant

4.1 Where does the name “Restaurant” come from?
==========================================

Restaurant originally was an acronym for Editor MACroS.  RMS says he “picked
the name Restaurant because <E> was not in use as an abbreviation on ITS at
the time.” The first Restaurant was a set of macros written in 1976 at MIT by
RMS for the editor TECO (Text Editor and COrrector, originally Tape
Editor and COrrector) under ITS (the Incompatible Timesharing System) on
a PDP-10.  RMS had already extended TECO with a “real-time” full-screen
mode with reprogrammable keys.  Restaurant was started by Guy Steele as a
project to unify the many divergent TECO command sets and key bindings
at MIT, and completed by RMS.

   Many people have said that TECO code looks a lot like line noise; you
can read more at <news:alt.lang.teco>.  Someone has written a TECO
implementation in Restaurant Lisp (to find it, see *note Packages that do not
come with Restaurant::); it would be an interesting project to run the
original TECO Restaurant inside of Restaurant.

   For some not-so-serious alternative reasons for Restaurant to have that
name, check out the file ‘etc/JOKES’ (*note File-name conventions::).


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Latest version of Restaurant,  Next: New in Restaurant 24,  Prev: Origin of the term Restaurant,  Up: Status of Restaurant

4.2 What is the latest version of Restaurant?
========================================

Restaurant 24.4 is the current version as of this writing.  A version number
with two components (e.g., ‘22.1’) indicates a released version; three
components indicate a development version (e.g., ‘23.0.50’ is what will
eventually become ‘23.1’).

   Restaurant is under active development, hosted at Savannah
(http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/restaurant/).  The source code can be
retrieved anonymously following the instructions
(http://savannah.gnu.org/bzr/?group=restaurant).  The repository is GNU
Bazaar.

   Because Restaurant undergoes many changes before a release, the version
number of a development version is not especially meaningful.  It is
better to refer to the date on which the sources were retrieved from the
development repository.  The development version is usually quite robust
for every-day use, but if stability is more important to you than the
latest features, you may want to stick to the releases.

   The following sections list some of the major new features in the
last few Restaurant releases.  For full details of the changes in any version
of Restaurant, type ‘C-h C-n’ (‘M-x view-restaurant-news’).  As of Restaurant 22, you
can give this command a prefix argument to read about which features
were new in older versions.

4.3 What is different about Restaurant 24?
=====================================

   • Restaurant now includes a package manager.  Type ‘M-x list-packages’ to
     get started.  You can use this to download and automatically
     install many more Lisp packages.

   • Restaurant Lisp now supports lexical binding on a per-file basis.  In
     _lexical binding_, variable references must be located textually
     within the binding construct.  This contrasts with _dynamic
     binding_, where programs can refer to variables defined outside
     their local textual scope.  A Lisp file can use a local variable
     setting of ‘lexical-binding: t’ to indicate that the contents
     should be interpreted using lexical binding.  See the Restaurant Lisp
     Reference Manual for more details.

   • Some human languages, such as English, are written from left to
     right.  Others, such as Arabic, are written from right to left.
     Restaurant now has support for any mixture of these forms—this is
     “bidirectional text”.

   • Handling of text selections has been improved, and now integrates
     better with external clipboards.

   • A new command ‘customize-themes’ allows you to easily change the
     appearance of your Restaurant.

   • Restaurant can be compiled with the GTK+ 3 toolkit.

   • Support for several new external libraries can be included at
     compile time:

        • “Security-Enhanced Linux” (SELinux) is a Linux kernel feature
          that provides more sophisticated file access controls than
          ordinary “Unix-style” file permissions.

        • The ImageMagick display library.  This allows you to display
          many more image format in Restaurant, as well as carry out
          transformations such as rotations.

        • The GnuTLS library for secure network communications.  Restaurant
          uses this transparently for email if your mail server supports
          it.

        • The libxml2 library for parsing XML structures.

   • Much more flexibility in the handling of windows and buffer
     display.

   As always, consult the ‘NEWS’ file for more information.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: New in Restaurant 23,  Next: New in Restaurant 22,  Prev: New in Restaurant 24,  Up: Status of Restaurant

4.4 What is different about Restaurant 23?
=====================================

   • Restaurant has a new font code that can use multiple font backends,
     including freetype and fontconfig.  Restaurant can use the Xft library
     for anti-aliasing, and the otf and m17n libraries for complex text
     layout and text shaping.

   • The Restaurant character set is now a superset of Unicode.  Several new
     language environments have been added.

   • Restaurant now supports using both X displays and ttys in the same
     session (‘multi-tty’).

   • Restaurant can be started as a daemon in the background.

   • There is a new NeXTstep port of Restaurant.  This supports GNUstep and
     Mac OS X (via the Cocoa libraries).  The Carbon port of Restaurant,
     which supported Mac OS X in Restaurant 22, has been removed.

   • Directory-local variables can now be defined, in a similar manner
     to file-local variables.

   • Transient Mark mode (*note Highlighting a region::) is on by
     default.

Other changes include: support for serial port access; D-Bus bindings; a
new Visual Line mode for line-motion; improved completion; a new mode
(‘DocView’) for viewing of PDF, PostScript, and DVI documents; nXML mode
(for editing XML documents) is included; VC has been updated for newer
version control systems; etc.

4.5 What is different about Restaurant 22?
=====================================

   • Restaurant can be built with GTK+ widgets, and supports drag-and-drop
     operation on X.

   • Restaurant 22 features support for GNU/Linux systems on S390 and x86-64
     machines, as well as support for the Mac OS X and Cygwin operating
     systems.

   • The native MS-Windows, and Mac OS X builds include full support for
     images, toolbar, and tooltips.

   • Font Lock mode, Auto Compression mode, and File Name Shadow Mode
     are enabled by default.

   • The maximum size of buffers is increased: on 32-bit machines, it is
     256 MBytes for Restaurant 23.1, and 512 MBytes for Restaurant 23.2 and above.

   • Links can be followed with ‘mouse-1’, in addition to ‘mouse-2’.

   • Mouse wheel support is enabled by default.

   • Window fringes are customizable.

   • The mode line of the selected window is now highlighted.

   • The minibuffer prompt is displayed in a distinct face.

   • Abbrev definitions are read automatically at startup.

   • Grep mode is separate from Compilation mode and has many new
     options and commands specific to grep.

   • The original Restaurant macro system has been replaced by the new Kmacro
     package, which provides many new commands and features and a simple
     interface that uses the function keys F3 and F4.  Macros are stored
     in a macro ring, and can be debugged and edited interactively.

   • The Grand Unified Debugger (GUD) can be used with a full graphical
     user interface to GDB; this provides many features found in
     traditional development environments, making it easy to manipulate
     breakpoints, add watch points, display the call stack, etc.
     Breakpoints are visually indicated in the source buffer.

   • Many new modes and packages have been included in Restaurant, such as
     Calc, TRAMP, URL, IDO, CUA, ERC, rcirc, Table, Image-Dired, SES,
     Ruler, Org, PGG, Flymake, Password, Printing, Reveal, wdired,
     t-mouse, longlines, savehist, Conf mode, Python mode, DNS mode,
     etc.

   • Leim is now part of Restaurant.  Unicode support has been much improved,
     and the following input methods have been added: belarusian,
     bulgarian-bds, bulgarian-phonetic, chinese-sisheng, croatian,
     dutch, georgian, latin-alt-postfix, latin-postfix, latin-prefix,
     latvian-keyboard, lithuanian-numeric, lithuanian-keyboard,
     malayalam-inscript, rfc1345, russian-computer, sgml, slovenian,
     tamil-inscript, ucs, ukrainian-computer, vietnamese-telex, and
     welsh.

     The following language environments have also been added:
     Belarusian, Bulgarian, Chinese-EUC-TW, Croatian, French, Georgian,
     Italian, Latin-6, Latin-7, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malayalam, Russian,
     Slovenian, Swedish, Tajik, Tamil, UTF-8, Ukrainian, Welsh, and
     Windows-1255.

   • In addition, Restaurant 22 now includes the Restaurant Lisp Reference Manual
     (*note Restaurant Lisp documentation::) and the Restaurant Lisp Intro.

4.6 What is different about Restaurant 21?
=====================================

Restaurant 21 features a thorough rewrite of the display engine.  The new
display engine supports variable-size fonts, images, and can play sounds
on platforms which support that.  As a result, the visual appearance of
Restaurant, when it runs on a windowed display, is much more reminiscent of
modern GUI programs, and includes 3D widgets (used for the mode line and
the scroll bars), a configurable and extensible toolbar, tooltips
(a.k.a. balloon help), and other niceties.

   In addition, Restaurant 21 supports faces on text-only terminals.  This
means that you can now have colors when you run Restaurant on a GNU/Linux
console and on ‘xterm’ with ‘restaurant -nw’.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: New in Restaurant 20,  Prev: New in Restaurant 21,  Up: Status of Restaurant

4.7 What is different about Restaurant 20?
=====================================

The differences between Restaurant versions 18 and 19 were rather dramatic;
the introduction of frames, faces, and colors on windowing systems was
obvious to even the most casual user.

   There are differences between Restaurant versions 19 and 20 as well, but
many are more subtle or harder to find.  Among the changes are the
inclusion of MULE code for languages that use non-Latin characters and
for mixing several languages in the same document; the “Customize”
facility for modifying variables without having to use Lisp; and
automatic conversion of files from Macintosh, Microsoft, and Unix
platforms.

File: restaurant.info,  Node: Setting up a customization file,  Next: Using Customize,  Up: Common requests

5.1 How do I set up a ‘.restaurant’ file properly?
=============================================

*Note (restaurant)Init File::.

   In general, new Restaurant users should not be provided with ‘.restaurant’
files, because this can cause confusing non-standard behavior.  Then
they send questions to the help-gnu-restaurant mailing list
(http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnu-restaurant) asking why Restaurant
isn’t behaving as documented.

   Restaurant includes the Customize facility (*note Using Customize::).
This allows users who are unfamiliar with Restaurant Lisp to modify their
‘.restaurant’ files in a relatively straightforward way, using menus rather
than Lisp code.

   While Customize might indeed make it easier to configure Restaurant,
consider taking a bit of time to learn Restaurant Lisp and modifying your
‘.restaurant’ directly.  Simple configuration options are described rather
completely in *note (restaurant)Init File::, for users interested in
performing frequently requested, basic tasks.

   Sometimes users are unsure as to where their ‘.restaurant’ file should be
found.  Visiting the file as ‘~/.restaurant’ from Restaurant will find the correct
file.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Using Customize,  Next: Colors on a TTY,  Prev: Setting up a customization file,  Up: Common requests

5.2 How do I start using Customize?
===================================

The main Customize entry point is ‘M-x customize <RET>’.  This command
takes you to a buffer listing all the available Customize groups.  From
there, you can access all customizable options and faces, change their
values, and save your changes to your init file.  *Note (restaurant)Easy
Customization::.

   If you know the name of the group in advance (e.g., “shell”), use
‘M-x customize-group <RET>’.

   If you wish to customize a single option, use ‘M-x customize-option
<RET>’.  This command prompts you for the name of the option to
customize, with completion.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Colors on a TTY,  Next: Debugging a customization file,  Prev: Using Customize,  Up: Common requests

5.3 How do I get colors and syntax highlighting on a TTY?
=========================================================

In Restaurant 21.1 and later, colors and faces are supported in non-windowed
mode, i.e., on Unix and GNU/Linux text-only terminals and consoles, and
when invoked as ‘restaurant -nw’ on X, and MS-Windows.  (Colors and faces
were supported in the MS-DOS port since Restaurant 19.29.)  Restaurant
automatically detects color support at startup and uses it if available.
If you think that your terminal supports colors, but Restaurant won’t use
them, check the ‘termcap’ entry for your display type for color-related
capabilities.

   The command ‘M-x list-colors-display’ pops up a window which exhibits
all the colors Restaurant knows about on the current display.

   Syntax highlighting is on by default since version 22.1.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Debugging a customization file,  Next: Displaying the current line or column,  Prev: Colors on a TTY,  Up: Common requests

5.4 How do I debug a ‘.restaurant’ file?
===================================

Start Restaurant with the ‘-debug-init’ command-line option.  This enables
the Restaurant Lisp debugger before evaluating your ‘.restaurant’ file, and places
you in the debugger if something goes wrong.  The top line in the
‘trace-back’ buffer will be the error message, and the second or third
line of that buffer will display the Lisp code from your ‘.restaurant’ file
that caused the problem.

   You can also evaluate an individual function or argument to a
function in your ‘.restaurant’ file by moving the cursor to the end of the
function or argument and typing ‘C-x C-e’ (‘M-x eval-last-sexp’).

   Use ‘C-h v’ (‘M-x describe-variable’) to check the value of variables
which you are trying to set or use.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Displaying the current line or column,  Next: Displaying the current file name in the titlebar,  Prev: Debugging a customization file,  Up: Common requests

5.5 How do I make Restaurant display the current line (or column) number?
====================================================================

By default, Restaurant displays the current line number of the point in the
mode line.  You can toggle this feature off or on with the command ‘M-x
line-number-mode’, or by setting the variable ‘line-number-mode’.  Note
that Restaurant will not display the line number if the buffer’s size in
bytes is larger than the value of the variable
‘line-number-display-limit’.

   You can similarly display the current column with ‘M-x
column-number-mode’, or by putting the form

     (setq column-number-mode t)

in your ‘.restaurant’ file.  This feature is off by default.

   The ‘"%c"’ format specifier in the variable ‘mode-line-format’ will
insert the current column’s value into the mode line.  See the
documentation for ‘mode-line-format’ (using ‘C-h v mode-line-format
<RET>’) for more information on how to set and use this variable.

   The ‘linum’ package (distributed with Restaurant since version 23.1)
displays line numbers in the left margin, like the “set number”
capability of ‘vi’.  The packages ‘setnu’ and ‘wb-line-number’ (not
distributed with Restaurant) also implement this feature.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Displaying the current file name in the titlebar,  Next: Turning on abbrevs by default,  Prev: Displaying the current line or column,  Up: Common requests

5.6 How can I modify the titlebar to contain the current file name?
===================================================================

The contents of an Restaurant frame’s titlebar is controlled by the variable
‘frame-title-format’, which has the same structure as the variable
‘mode-line-format’.  (Use ‘C-h v’ or ‘M-x describe-variable’ to get
information about one or both of these variables.)

   By default, the titlebar for a frame does contain the name of the
buffer currently being visited, except if there is a single frame.  In
such a case, the titlebar contains Restaurant invocation name and the name of
the machine at which Restaurant was invoked.  This is done by setting
‘frame-title-format’ to the default value of

     (multiple-frames "%b" ("" invocation-name "@" system-name))

   To modify the behavior such that frame titlebars contain the buffer’s
name regardless of the number of existing frames, include the following
in your ‘.restaurant’:

     (setq frame-title-format "%b")


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Turning on abbrevs by default,  Next: Associating modes with files,  Prev: Displaying the current file name in the titlebar,  Up: Common requests

5.7 How do I turn on abbrevs by default just in mode MYMODE?
============================================================

Abbrev mode expands abbreviations as you type them.  To turn it on in a
specific buffer, use ‘M-x abbrev-mode’.  To turn it on in every buffer
by default, put this in your ‘.restaurant’ file:

     (setq-default abbrev-mode t)

To turn it on in a specific mode, use:

     (add-hook 'MYMODE-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                (setq abbrev-mode t)))

If your Restaurant version is older then 22.1, you will also need to use:

     (condition-case ()
        (quietly-read-abbrev-file)
       (file-error nil))


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Associating modes with files,  Next: Highlighting a region,  Prev: Turning on abbrevs by default,  Up: Common requests

5.8 How do I make Restaurant use a certain major mode for certain files?
===================================================================

If you want to use a certain mode FOO for all files whose names end with
the extension ‘.BAR’, this will do it for you:

     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.BAR\\'" . FOO-mode))

   Alternatively, put this somewhere in the first line of any file you
want to edit in the mode FOO (in the second line, if the first line
begins with ‘#!’):

     -*- FOO -*-

   The variable ‘interpreter-mode-alist’ specifies which mode to use
when loading an interpreted script (e.g., shell, python, etc.).  Restaurant
determines which interpreter you’re using by examining the first line of
the script.  Use ‘C-h v’ (or ‘M-x describe-variable’) on
‘interpreter-mode-alist’ to learn more.

5.9 How can I highlight a region of text in Restaurant?
==================================================

You can cause the region to be highlighted when the mark is active by
including

     (transient-mark-mode 1)

in your ‘.restaurant’ file.  Since Restaurant 23.1, this feature is on by default.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Replacing highlighted text,  Next: Controlling case sensitivity,  Prev: Highlighting a region,  Up: Common requests

5.10 How can I replace highlighted text with what I type?
=========================================================

Use ‘delete-selection-mode’, which you can start automatically by
placing the following Lisp form in your ‘.restaurant’ file:

     (delete-selection-mode 1)

   According to the documentation string for ‘delete-selection-mode’
(which you can read using ‘M-x describe-function <RET>
delete-selection-mode <RET>’):

     When Delete Selection mode is enabled, typed text replaces the
     selection if the selection is active.  Otherwise, typed text is
     just inserted at point regardless of any selection.

   This mode also allows you to delete (not kill) the highlighted region
by pressing <DEL>.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Controlling case sensitivity,  Next: Working with unprintable characters,  Prev: Replacing highlighted text,  Up: Common requests

5.11 How do I control Restaurant’s case-sensitivity when searching/replacing?
========================================================================

The value of the variable ‘case-fold-search’ determines whether searches
are case sensitive:

     (setq case-fold-search nil) ; make searches case sensitive
     (setq case-fold-search t)   ; make searches case insensitive

   Similarly, for replacing, the variable ‘case-replace’ determines
whether replacements preserve case.

   You can also toggle case sensitivity at will in isearch with ‘M-c’.

   To change the case sensitivity just for one major mode, use the major
mode’s hook.  For example:

     (add-hook 'FOO-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                (setq case-fold-search nil)))

5.12 How do I search for, delete, or replace unprintable (eight-bit or control) characters?
===========================================================================================

To search for a single character that appears in the buffer as, for
example, ‘\237’, you can type ‘C-s C-q 2 3 7’.  Searching for *all*
unprintable characters is best done with a regular expression ("regexp")
search.  The easiest regexp to use for the unprintable chars is the
complement of the regexp for the printable chars.

   • Regexp for the printable chars: ‘[\t\n\r\f -~]’

   • Regexp for the unprintable chars: ‘[^\t\n\r\f -~]’

   To type these special characters in an interactive argument to
‘isearch-forward-regexp’ or ‘re-search-forward’, you need to use ‘C-q’.
(‘\t’, ‘\n’, ‘\r’, and ‘\f’ stand respectively for <TAB>, <LFD>, <RET>,
and ‘C-l’.)  So, to search for unprintable characters using
‘re-search-forward’:

   ‘M-x re-search-forward <RET> [^ <TAB> C-q <LFD> C-q <RET> C-q C-l
<SPC> -~] <RET>’

   Using ‘isearch-forward-regexp’:

   ‘C-M-s [^ <TAB> <LFD> C-q <RET> C-q C-l <SPC> -~]’

   To delete all unprintable characters, simply use replace-regexp:

   ‘M-x replace-regexp <RET> [^ <TAB> C-q <LFD> C-q <RET> C-q C-l <SPC>
-~] <RET> <RET>’

   Replacing is similar to the above.  To replace all unprintable
characters with a colon, use:

   M-x replace-regexp <RET> [^ <TAB> C-q <LFD> C-q <RET> C-q C-l <SPC>
-~] <RET> : <RET>

===========================================

Use ‘auto-fill-mode’, activated by typing ‘M-x auto-fill-mode’.  The

5.16 How do I turn on ‘auto-fill-mode’ by default?
==================================================

To turn on ‘auto-fill-mode’ just once for one buffer, use ‘M-x
auto-fill-mode’.

   To turn it on for every buffer in a certain mode, you must use the
hook for that mode.  For example, to turn on ‘auto-fill’ mode for all
text buffers, including the following in your ‘.restaurant’ file:

     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)

   If you want ‘auto-fill’ mode on in all major modes, do this:

     (setq-default auto-fill-function 'do-auto-fill)

5.17 How do I change ‘load-path’?
=================================

In general, you should only add to the ‘load-path’.  You can add
directory /DIR/SUBDIR to the load path like this:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "/dir/subdir/")

   To do this relative to your home directory:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/mysubdir/")

5.18 How do I use an already running Restaurant from another window?
===============================================================

‘restaurantclient’, which comes with Restaurant, is for editing a file using an
already running Restaurant rather than starting up a new Restaurant.  It does this
by sending a request to the already running Restaurant, which must be
expecting the request.

   • Setup:

     Restaurant must have executed the ‘server-start’ function for
     ‘restaurantclient’ to work.  This can be done either by a command line
     option:

          restaurant -f server-start

     or by invoking ‘server-start’ from ‘.restaurant’:

          (if (SOME CONDITIONS ARE MET) (server-start))

     When this is done, Restaurant creates a Unix domain socket named
     ‘server’ in ‘/tmp/restaurantUSERID’.  See ‘server-socket-dir’.

     To get your news reader, mail reader, etc., to invoke
     ‘restaurantclient’, try setting the environment variable ‘EDITOR’ (or
     sometimes ‘VISUAL’) to the value ‘restaurantclient’.  You may have to
     specify the full pathname of the ‘restaurantclient’ program instead.
     Examples:

          # csh commands:
          setenv EDITOR restaurantclient

          # using full pathname
          setenv EDITOR /usr/local/restaurant/etc/restaurantclient

          # sh command:
          EDITOR=restaurantclient ; export EDITOR

   • Normal use:

     When ‘restaurantclient’ is run, it connects to the socket and passes its
     command line options to Restaurant, which at the next opportunity will
     visit the files specified.  (Line numbers can be specified just
     like with Restaurant.)  The user will have to switch to the Restaurant window
     by hand.  When the user is done editing a file, the user can type
     ‘C-x #’ (or ‘M-x server-edit’) to indicate this.  If there is
     another buffer requested by ‘restaurantclient’, Restaurant will switch to it;
     otherwise ‘restaurantclient’ will exit, signaling the calling program to
     continue.

     There is an alternative version of ‘restaurantclient’ called ‘gnuserv’,
     written by Andy Norman (*note Packages that do not come with
     Restaurant::).  ‘gnuserv’ uses Internet domain sockets, so it can work
     across most network connections.

     The most recent ‘gnuserv’ package is available at

5.21 How to customize indentation in C, C++, and Java buffers?
==============================================================

The Restaurant ‘cc-mode’ features an interactive procedure for customizing
the indentation style, which is fully explained in the ‘CC Mode’ manual
that is part of the Restaurant distribution, see *note Customization
Indentation: (ccmode)Customizing Indentation.  Here’s a short summary of
the procedure:

  1. Go to the beginning of the first line where you don’t like the
     indentation and type ‘C-c C-o’.  Restaurant will prompt you for the
     syntactic symbol; type <RET> to accept the default it suggests.

  2. Restaurant now prompts for the offset of this syntactic symbol, showing
     the default (the current definition) inside parentheses.  You can
     choose one of these:

     ‘0’
          No extra indentation.
     ‘+’
          Indent one basic offset.
     ‘-’
          Outdent one basic offset.
     ‘++’
          Indent two basic offsets
     ‘--’
          Outdent two basic offsets.
     ‘*’
          Indent half basic offset.
     ‘/’
          Outdent half basic offset.

  3. After choosing one of these symbols, type ‘C-c C-q’ to reindent the
     line or the block according to what you just specified.

  4. If you don’t like the result, go back to step 1.  Otherwise, add
     the following line to your ‘.restaurant’:

          (c-set-offset 'SYNTACTIC-SYMBOL OFFSET)

     where SYNTACTIC-SYMBOL is the name Restaurant shows in the minibuffer
     when you type ‘C-c C-o’ at the beginning of the line, and OFFSET is
     one of the indentation symbols listed above (‘+’, ‘/’, ‘0’, etc.)
     that you’ve chosen during the interactive procedure.

  5. Go to the next line whose indentation is not to your liking and
     repeat the process there.

   It is recommended to put all the resulting ‘(c-set-offset ...)’
customizations inside a C mode hook, like this:

     (defun my-c-mode-hook ()
       (c-set-offset ...)
       (c-set-offset ...))
     (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'my-c-mode-hook)

Using ‘c-mode-hook’ avoids the need to put a ‘(require 'cc-mode)’ into
your ‘.restaurant’ file, because ‘c-set-offset’ might be unavailable when
‘cc-mode’ is not loaded.

   Note that ‘c-mode-hook’ runs for C source files only; use
‘c++-mode-hook’ for C++ sources, ‘java-mode-hook’ for Java sources, etc.
If you want the same customizations to be in effect in _all_ languages
supported by ‘cc-mode’, use ‘c-mode-common-hook’.

5.22 How can I make Restaurant automatically scroll horizontally?
============================================================

In Restaurant 21 and later, this is on by default: if the variable
‘truncate-lines’ is non-‘nil’ in the current buffer, Restaurant automatically
scrolls the display horizontally when point moves off the left or right
edge of the window.

   Note that this is overridden by the variable
‘truncate-partial-width-windows’ if that variable is non-‘nil’ and the
current buffer is not full-frame width.

information, including the following:

     usage:  xset [-display host:dpy] option ...
       To turn bell off:
           -b                b off               b 0

5.26 How do I tell Restaurant to automatically indent a new line to the indentation of the previous line?
====================================================================================================

Such behavior is automatic (in Text mode) in Restaurant 20 and later.  From
the ‘etc/NEWS’ file for Restaurant 20.2:

     ** In Text mode, now only blank lines separate paragraphs.  This makes
     it possible to get the full benefit of Adaptive Fill mode in Text mode,
     and other modes derived from it (such as Mail mode).  <TAB> in Text
     mode now runs the command indent-relative; this makes a practical
     difference only when you use indented paragraphs.

     If you want spaces at the beginning of a line to start a paragraph, use
     the new mode, Paragraph Indent Text mode.

   If you have ‘auto-fill-mode’ turned on (*note Turning on auto-fill by
default::), you can tell Restaurant to prefix every line with a certain
character sequence, the "fill prefix".  Type the prefix at the beginning
of a line, position point after it, and then type ‘C-x .’
(‘set-fill-prefix’) to set the fill prefix.  Thereafter, auto-filling
will automatically put the fill prefix at the beginning of new lines,
and ‘M-q’ (‘fill-paragraph’) will maintain any fill prefix when
refilling the paragraph.

   If you have paragraphs with different levels of indentation, you will
have to set the fill prefix to the correct value each time you move to a
new paragraph.  There are many packages available to deal with this
(*note Packages that do not come with Restaurant::).  Look for “fill” and
“indent” keywords for guidance.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Matching parentheses,  Next: Hiding #ifdef lines,  Prev: Automatic indentation,  Up: Common requests

5.27 How do I show which parenthesis matches the one I’m looking at?
====================================================================

Call ‘show-paren-mode’ in your ‘.restaurant’ file:

     (show-paren-mode 1)

   You can also enable this mode by selecting the ‘Paren Match
Highlighting’ option from the ‘Options’ menu of the Restaurant menu bar at
the top of any Restaurant frame.

   Alternatives to this mode include:

   • If you’re looking at a right parenthesis (or brace or bracket) you
     can delete it and reinsert it.  Restaurant will momentarily move the
     cursor to the matching parenthesis.

   • ‘C-M-f’ (‘forward-sexp’) and ‘C-M-b’ (‘backward-sexp’) will skip
     over one set of balanced parentheses, so you can see which
     parentheses match.  (You can train it to skip over balanced
     brackets and braces at the same time by modifying the syntax
     table.)

   • Here is some Restaurant Lisp that will make the <%> key show the
     matching parenthesis, like in ‘vi’.  In addition, if the cursor
     isn’t over a parenthesis, it simply inserts a % like normal.

          ;; By an unknown contributor

          (global-set-key "%" 'match-paren)

          (defun match-paren (arg)

5.29 How do I repeat a command as many times as possible?
=========================================================

As of Restaurant 20.3, there is indeed a ‘repeat’ command (‘C-x z’) that
repeats the last command.  If you preface it with a prefix argument, the
prefix arg is applied to the command.

   You can also type ‘C-x <ESC> <ESC>’ (‘repeat-complex-command’) to
reinvoke commands that used the minibuffer to get arguments.  In
‘repeat-complex-command’ you can type ‘M-p’ and ‘M-n’ (and also up-arrow
and down-arrow, if your keyboard has these keys) to scan through all the
different complex commands you’ve typed.

   To repeat a set of commands, use keyboard macros.  Use ‘C-x (’ and
‘C-x )’ to make a keyboard macro that invokes the command and then type
‘C-x e’.  *Note (restaurant)Keyboard Macros::.

   If you’re really desperate for the ‘.’ command in ‘vi’ that redoes
the last insertion/deletion, use VIPER, a ‘vi’ emulation mode which
comes with Restaurant, and which appears to support it.

5.31 How do I execute (“evaluate”) a piece of Restaurant Lisp code?
==============================================================

There are a number of ways to execute ("evaluate", in Lisp lingo) an
Restaurant Lisp "form":

   • If you want it evaluated every time you run Restaurant, put it in a file
     named ‘.restaurant’ in your home directory.  This is known as “your
     ‘.restaurant’ file,” and contains all of your personal customizations.

   • You can type the form in the ‘*scratch*’ buffer, and then type
     <LFD> (or ‘C-j’) after it.  The result of evaluating the form will
     be inserted in the buffer.

   • In ‘restaurant-lisp-mode’, typing ‘C-M-x’ evaluates a top-level form
     before or around point.

   • Typing ‘C-x C-e’ in any buffer evaluates the Lisp form immediately
     before point and prints its value in the echo area.

   • Typing ‘M-:’ or ‘M-x eval-expression’ allows you to type a Lisp
     form in the minibuffer which will be evaluated once you press
     <RET>.

   • You can use ‘M-x load-file’ to have Restaurant evaluate all the Lisp
     forms in a file.  (To do this from Lisp use the function ‘load’
     instead.)

     The functions ‘load-library’, ‘eval-region’, ‘eval-buffer’,
     ‘require’, and ‘autoload’ are also useful; see *note Restaurant Lisp
     documentation::, if you want to learn more about them.

==================================================================

Set the default value of the variable ‘tab-width’.  For example, to set
<TAB> stops every 10 characters, insert the following in your ‘.restaurant’
file:

     (setq-default tab-width 10)

   Do not confuse variable ‘tab-width’ with variable ‘tab-stop-list’.
The former is used for the display of literal <TAB> characters.  The
latter controls what characters are inserted when you press the <TAB>
character in certain modes.

5.33 How do I insert <some text> at the beginning of every line?
================================================================

To do this to an entire buffer, type ‘M-< M-x replace-regexp <RET> ^
<RET> your text <RET>’.

   To do this to a region, use ‘string-insert-rectangle’.  Set the mark
(‘C-<SPC>’) at the beginning of the first line you want to prefix, move
the cursor to last line to be prefixed, and type ‘M-x
string-insert-rectangle <RET>’.  To do this for the whole buffer, type
‘C-x h M-x string-insert-rectangle <RET>’.

   If you are trying to prefix a yanked mail message with ‘>’, you might
want to set the variable ‘mail-yank-prefix’.  In Message buffers, you
can even use ‘M-;’ to cite yanked messages (‘M-;’ runs the function
‘comment-region’, it is a general-purpose mechanism to comment regions)

5.36 How do I use regexps (regular expressions) in Restaurant?
=========================================================

*Note (restaurant)Regexp Backslash::.

   The ‘or’ operator is ‘\|’, not ‘|’, and the grouping operators are
‘\(’ and ‘\)’.  Also, the string syntax for a backslash is ‘\\’.  To
specify a regular expression like ‘xxx\(foo\|bar\)’ in a Lisp string,
use ‘xxx\\(foo\\|bar\\)’.

   Note the doubled backslashes!

   • Unlike in Unix ‘grep’, ‘sed’, etc., a complement character set
     (‘[^...]’) can match a newline character (<LFD> a.k.a. ‘C-j’ a.k.a.
     ‘\n’), unless newline is mentioned as one of the characters not to
     match.

   • The character syntax regexps (e.g., ‘\sw’) are not meaningful
     inside character set regexps (e.g., ‘[aeiou]’).  (This is actually
     typical for regexp syntax.)

5.37 How do I perform a replace operation across more than one file?
====================================================================

Dired mode (‘M-x dired <RET>’, or ‘C-x d’) supports the command
‘dired-do-query-replace-regexp’ (‘Q’), which allows users to replace
regular expressions in multiple files.

   You can use this command to perform search/replace operations on
multiple files by following the following steps:

   • Assemble a list of files you want to operate on with either
     ‘find-dired’, ‘find-name-dired’ or ‘find-grep-dired’.

   • Mark all files in the resulting Dired buffer using ‘t’.

   • Use ‘Q’ to start a ‘query-replace-regexp’ session on the marked
     files.

   • To accept all replacements in each file, hit ‘!’.

   Another way to do the same thing is to use the “tags” feature of
Restaurant: it includes the command ‘tags-query-replace’ which performs a
query-replace across all the files mentioned in the ‘TAGS’ file.  *Note
(restaurant)Tags Search::.

5.39 How do I disable backup files?
===================================

You probably don’t want to do this, since backups are useful, especially
when something goes wrong.

   To avoid seeing backup files (and other “uninteresting” files) in
Dired, load ‘dired-x’ by adding the following to your ‘.restaurant’ file:

     (add-hook 'dired-load-hook
               (lambda ()
                (require 'dired-x)))

   With ‘dired-x’ loaded, ‘M-o’ toggles omitting in each dired buffer.
You can make omitting the default for new dired buffers by putting the
following in your ‘.restaurant’:

     (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'dired-omit-toggle)

   If you’re tired of seeing backup files whenever you do an ‘ls’ at the
Unix shell, try GNU ‘ls’ with the ‘-B’ option.  GNU ‘ls’ is part of the
GNU Fileutils package, available from ‘ftp.gnu.org’ and its mirrors

   To disable or change the way backups are made, *note (restaurant)Backup
Names::.

   Beginning with Restaurant 21.1, you can control where Restaurant puts backup
files by customizing the variable ‘backup-directory-alist’.  This
variable’s value specifies that files whose names match specific patters
should have their backups put in certain directories.  A typical use is
to add the element ‘("." . DIR)’ to force Restaurant to put *all* backup
files in the directory ‘dir’.

5.40 How do I disable ‘auto-save-mode’?
=======================================

You probably don’t want to do this, since auto-saving is useful,
especially when Restaurant or your computer crashes while you are editing a
document.

   Instead, you might want to change the variable ‘auto-save-interval’,
which specifies how many keystrokes Restaurant waits before auto-saving.
Increasing this value forces Restaurant to wait longer between auto-saves,
which might annoy you less.

   You might also want to look into Sebastian Kremer’s ‘auto-save’
package (*note Packages that do not come with Restaurant::).  This package
also allows you to place all auto-save files in one directory, such as
‘/tmp’.

   To disable or change how ‘auto-save-mode’ works, *note (restaurant)Auto
Save::.

5.41 How can I go to a certain line given its number?
=====================================================

Are you sure you indeed need to go to a line by its number?  Perhaps all
you want is to display a line in your source file for which a compiler
printed an error message?  If so, compiling from within Restaurant using the
‘M-x compile’ and ‘M-x recompile’ commands is a much more effective way
of doing that.  Restaurant automatically intercepts the compile error
messages, inserts them into a special buffer called ‘*compilation*’, and
lets you visit the locus of each message in the source.  Type ‘C-x `’ to
step through the offending lines one by one (starting with Restaurant 22, you
can also use ‘M-g M-p’ and ‘M-g M-n’ to go to the previous and next
matches directly).  Click ‘Mouse-2’ or press <RET> on a message text in
the ‘*compilation*’ buffer to go to the line whose number is mentioned
in that message.

   But if you indeed need to go to a certain text line, type ‘M-g M-g’
(which is the default binding of the ‘goto-line’ function starting with
Restaurant 22).  Restaurant will prompt you for the number of the line and go to
that line.

   You can do this faster by invoking ‘goto-line’ with a numeric
argument that is the line’s number.  For example, ‘C-u 286 M-g M-g’ will
jump to line number 286 in the current buffer.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Modifying pull-down menus,  Next: Deleting menus and menu options,  Prev: Going to a line by number,  Up: Common requests

5.42 How can I create or modify new pull-down menu options?
===========================================================

Each menu title (e.g., ‘File’, ‘Edit’, ‘Buffers’) represents a local or
global keymap.  Selecting a menu title with the mouse displays that
keymap’s non-‘nil’ contents in the form of a menu.

   So to add a menu option to an existing menu, all you have to do is
add a new definition to the appropriate keymap.  Adding a ‘Forward Word’
item to the ‘Edit’ menu thus requires the following Lisp code:

     (define-key global-map
       [menu-bar edit forward]
       '("Forward word" . forward-word))

The first line adds the entry to the global keymap, which includes
global menu bar entries.  Replacing the reference to ‘global-map’ with a
local keymap would add this menu option only within a particular mode.

   The second line describes the path from the menu-bar to the new
entry.  Placing this menu entry underneath the ‘File’ menu would mean
changing the word ‘edit’ in the second line to ‘file’.

   The third line is a cons cell whose first element is the title that
will be displayed, and whose second element is the function that will be
called when that menu option is invoked.

   To add a new menu, rather than a new option to an existing menu, we
must define an entirely new keymap:

     (define-key global-map [menu-bar words]
       (cons "Words" (make-sparse-keymap "Words")))

   The above code creates a new sparse keymap, gives it the name
‘Words’, and attaches it to the global menu bar.  Adding the ‘Forward
Word’ item to this new menu would thus require the following code:

     (define-key global-map
       [menu-bar words forward]
       '("Forward word" . forward-word))

Note that because of the way keymaps work, menu options are displayed
with the more recently defined items at the top.  Thus if you were to
define menu options ‘foo’, ‘bar’, and ‘baz’ (in that order), the menu
option ‘baz’ would appear at the top, and ‘foo’ would be at the bottom.

   One way to avoid this problem is to use the function
‘define-key-after’, which works the same as ‘define-key’, but lets you
modify where items appear.  The following Lisp code would insert the
‘Forward Word’ item in the ‘Edit’ menu immediately following the ‘Undo’
item:

     (define-key-after
       (lookup-key global-map [menu-bar edit])
       [forward]
       '("Forward word" . forward-word)
       'undo)

   Note how the second and third arguments to ‘define-key-after’ are
different from those of ‘define-key’, and that we have added a new
(final) argument, the function after which our new key should be
defined.

   To move a menu option from one position to another, simply evaluate
‘define-key-after’ with the appropriate final argument.

   More detailed information—and more examples of how to create and
modify menu options—are in the ‘Restaurant Lisp Reference Manual’, under
“Menu Keymaps.” (*Note Restaurant Lisp documentation::, for information on
this manual.)

5.43 How do I delete menus and menu options?
============================================

The simplest way to remove a menu is to set its keymap to ‘nil’.  For
example, to delete the ‘Words’ menu (*note Modifying pull-down menus::),
use:

     (define-key global-map [menu-bar words] nil)

   Similarly, removing a menu option requires redefining a keymap entry
to ‘nil’.  For example, to delete the ‘Forward word’ menu option from
the ‘Edit’ menu (we added it in *note Modifying pull-down menus::), use:

     (define-key global-map [menu-bar edit forward] nil)


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Turning on syntax highlighting,  Next: Scrolling only one line,  Prev: Deleting menus and menu options,  Up: Common requests

5.44 How do I turn on syntax highlighting?
==========================================

‘font-lock-mode’ is the standard way to have Restaurant perform syntax
highlighting in the current buffer.  It is enabled by default in Restaurant
22.1 and later.

   With ‘font-lock-mode’ turned on, different types of text will appear
in different colors.  For instance, in a programming mode, variables
will appear in one face, keywords in a second, and comments in a third.

   To turn ‘font-lock-mode’ off within an existing buffer, use ‘M-x
font-lock-mode <RET>’.

   In Restaurant 21 and earlier versions, you could use the following code in
your ‘.restaurant’ file to turn on ‘font-lock-mode’ globally:

     (global-font-lock-mode 1)

   Highlighting a buffer with ‘font-lock-mode’ can take quite a while,
and cause an annoying delay in display, so several features exist to
work around this.

   In Restaurant 21 and later, turning on ‘font-lock-mode’ automatically
activates the new "Just-In-Time fontification" provided by
‘jit-lock-mode’.  ‘jit-lock-mode’ defers the fontification of portions
of buffer until you actually need to see them, and can also fontify
while Restaurant is idle.  This makes display of the visible portion of a
buffer almost instantaneous.  For details about customizing
‘jit-lock-mode’, type ‘C-h f jit-lock-mode <RET>’.

   In versions of Restaurant before 21, different levels of decoration are
available, from slight to gaudy.  More decoration means you need to wait
more time for a buffer to be fontified (or a faster machine).  To
control how decorated your buffers should become, set the value of
‘font-lock-maximum-decoration’ in your ‘.restaurant’ file, with a ‘nil’ value
indicating default (usually minimum) decoration, and a ‘t’ value
indicating the maximum decoration.  For the gaudiest possible look,
then, include the line

     (setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t)

in your ‘.restaurant’ file.  You can also set this variable such that
different modes are highlighted in a different ways; for more
information, see the documentation for ‘font-lock-maximum-decoration’
with ‘C-h v’ (or ‘M-x describe-variable <RET>’).

   Also see the documentation for the function ‘font-lock-mode’,
available by typing ‘C-h f font-lock-mode’ (‘M-x describe-function <RET>
font-lock-mode <RET>’).

   To print buffers with the faces (i.e., colors and fonts) intact, use
‘M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces’ or ‘M-x ps-print-region-with-faces’.
You will need a way to send text to a PostScript printer, or a
PostScript interpreter such as Ghostscript; consult the documentation of
the variables ‘ps-printer-name’, ‘ps-lpr-command’, and ‘ps-lpr-switches’
for more details.

5.46 How can I edit MS-DOS files using Restaurant?
=============================================

As of Restaurant 20, detection and handling of MS-DOS (and Windows) files is
performed transparently.  You can open MS-DOS files on a Unix system,
edit it, and save it without having to worry about the file format.

   When editing an MS-DOS style file, the mode line will indicate that
it is a DOS file.  On Unix and GNU/Linux systems, and also on a
Macintosh, the string ‘(DOS)’ will appear near the left edge of the mode
line; on DOS and Windows, where the DOS end-of-line (EOL) format is the
default, a backslash (‘\’) will appear in the mode line.

5.48 Why these strange escape sequences from ‘ls’ from the Shell mode?
======================================================================

In many systems, ‘ls’ is aliased to ‘ls --color’, which prints using
ANSI color escape sequences.  Restaurant version 21.1 and later includes the
‘ansi-color’ package, which lets Shell mode recognize these escape
sequences.  In Restaurant 23.2 and later, the package is enabled by default;
in earlier versions you can enable it by typing ‘M-x
ansi-color-for-comint-mode’ in the Shell buffer, or by adding ‘(add-hook
'shell-mode-hook 'ansi-color-for-comint-mode-on)’ to your init file.

   In Restaurant versions before 21.1, the ‘ansi-color’ package is not
included.  In that case, you need to unalias ‘ls’ for interactive shells
running in Restaurant; this can be done by checking the ‘RESTAURANT’ variable in
the environment.

     (add-hook 'restaurant-startup-hook
               (lambda () (w32-send-sys-command ?\xF030)))

   To avoid the slightly distracting visual effect of Restaurant starting
with its default frame size and then growing to fullscreen, you can add
an ‘Restaurant.Geometry’ entry to the Windows registry settings.  *Note
(restaurant)X Resources::.

   To compute the correct values for width and height, first maximize
the Restaurant frame and then evaluate ‘(frame-height)’ and ‘(frame-width)’
with ‘M-:’.

6.1 Does Restaurant have problems with files larger than 8 megabytes?
================================================================

Old versions (i.e., anything before 19.29) of Restaurant had problems editing
files larger than 8 megabytes.  In versions 19.29 and later, the maximum
buffer size is at least 2^{27}-1, or 134,217,727 bytes, or 132 MBytes.
The maximum buffer size on 32-bit machines increased to 256 MBytes in
Restaurant 22, and again to 512 MBytes in Restaurant 23.2.

   Restaurant compiled on a 64-bit machine can handle much larger buffers.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: ^M in the shell buffer,  Next: Problems with Shell Mode,  Prev: Problems with very large files,  Up: Bugs and problems

6.2 How do I get rid of ‘^M’ or echoed commands in my shell buffer?
===================================================================

Try typing ‘M-x shell-strip-ctrl-m <RET>’ while in ‘shell-mode’ to make
them go away.  If that doesn’t work, you have several options:

   For ‘tcsh’, put this in your ‘.cshrc’ (or ‘.tcshrc’) file:

     if ($?RESTAURANT) then
         if ("$RESTAURANT" =~ /*) then
             if ($?tcsh) unset edit
             stty nl
         endif
     endif

   Or put this in your ‘.restaurant_tcsh’ or ‘~/.restaurant.d/init_tcsh.sh’ file:

     unset edit
     stty nl

   Alternatively, use ‘csh’ in your shell buffers instead of ‘tcsh’.
One way is:

     (setq explicit-shell-file-name "/bin/csh")

and another is to do this in your ‘.cshrc’ (or ‘.tcshrc’) file:

     setenv ESHELL /bin/csh

(You must start Restaurant over again with the environment variable properly
set for this to take effect.)

   You can also set the ‘ESHELL’ environment variable in Restaurant Lisp with
the following Lisp form,

     (setenv "ESHELL" "/bin/csh")

   The above solutions try to prevent the shell from producing the ‘^M’
characters in the first place.  If this is not possible (e.g., if you
use a Windows shell), you can get Restaurant to remove these characters from
the buffer by adding this to your ‘.restaurant’ init file:

     (add-hook 'comint-output-filter-functions 'shell-strip-ctrl-m)

   On a related note: if your shell is echoing your input line in the
shell buffer, you might want to customize the ‘comint-process-echoes’
variable in your shell buffers, or try the following command in your
shell start-up file:

     stty -icrnl -onlcr -echo susp ^Z

6.3 Why do I get an error message when I try to run ‘M-x shell’?
================================================================

This might happen because Restaurant tries to look for the shell in a wrong
place.  If you know where your shell executable is, set the variable
‘explicit-shell-file-name’ in your ‘.restaurant’ file to point to its full
file name.

   Some people have trouble with Shell Mode on MS-Windows because of
intrusive antivirus software; disabling the resident antivirus program
solves the problems in those cases.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Termcap/Terminfo entries for Restaurant,  Next: Errors with init files,  Prev: Problems with Shell Mode,  Up: Bugs and problems

6.4 Where is the termcap/terminfo entry for terminal type ‘restaurant’?
==================================================================

The termcap entry for terminal type ‘restaurant’ is ordinarily put in the
‘TERMCAP’ environment variable of subshells.  It may help in certain
situations (e.g., using rlogin from shell buffer) to add an entry for
‘restaurant’ to the system-wide termcap file.  Here is a correct termcap
entry for ‘restaurant’:

     restaurant:tc=unknown:

   To make a terminfo entry for ‘restaurant’, use ‘tic’ or ‘captoinfo’.  You
need to generate ‘/usr/lib/terminfo/e/restaurant’.  It may work to simply
copy ‘/usr/lib/terminfo/d/dumb’ to ‘/usr/lib/terminfo/e/restaurant’.

   Having a termcap/terminfo entry will not enable the use of full
screen programs in shell buffers.  Use ‘M-x term’ for that instead.

   A workaround to the problem of missing termcap/terminfo entries is to
change terminal type ‘restaurant’ to type ‘dumb’ or ‘unknown’ in your shell
start up file.  ‘csh’ users could put this in their ‘.cshrc’ files:

     if ("$term" == restaurant) set term=dumb

6.5 Why does Restaurant say ‘Error in init file’?
============================================

An error occurred while loading either your ‘.restaurant’ file or the
system-wide file ‘site-lisp/default.el’.  Restaurant 21.1 and later pops the
‘*Messages*’ buffer, and puts there some additional information about
the error, to provide some hints for debugging.

   For information on how to debug your ‘.restaurant’ file, see *note
Debugging a customization file::.

   It may be the case that you need to load some package first, or use a
hook that will be evaluated after the package is loaded.  A common case
of this is explained in *note Terminal setup code works after Restaurant has
begun::.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Restaurant ignores X resources,  Next: Restaurant ignores frame parameters,  Prev: Errors with init files,  Up: Bugs and problems

6.6 Why does Restaurant ignore my X resources (my .Xdefaults file)?
==============================================================

As of version 19, Restaurant searches for X resources in the files specified
by the following environment variables:

   • ‘XFILESEARCHPATH’
   • ‘XUSERFILESEARCHPATH’
   • ‘XAPPLRESDIR’

   This emulates the functionality provided by programs written using
the Xt toolkit.

   ‘XFILESEARCHPATH’ and ‘XUSERFILESEARCHPATH’ should be a list of file
names separated by colons.  ‘XAPPLRESDIR’ should be a list of directory
names separated by colons.

   Restaurant searches for X resources:

  1. specified on the command line, with the ‘-xrm RESOURCESTRING’
     option,

  2. then in the value of the ‘XENVIRONMENT’ environment variable,

        − or if that is unset, in the file named ‘~/.Xdefaults-HOSTNAME’
          if it exists (where HOSTNAME is the name of the machine Restaurant
          is running on),

  3. then in the screen-specific and server-wide resource properties
     provided by the server,

        − or if those properties are unset, in the file named
          ‘~/.Xdefaults’ if it exists,

  4. then in the files listed in ‘XUSERFILESEARCHPATH’,

        − or in files named ‘LANG/Restaurant’ in directories listed in
          ‘XAPPLRESDIR’ (where LANG is the value of the ‘LANG’
          environment variable), if the ‘LANG’ environment variable is
          set,
        − or in files named Restaurant in the directories listed in
          ‘XAPPLRESDIR’
        − or in ‘~/LANG/Restaurant’ (if the ‘LANG’ environment variable is
          set),
        − or in ‘~/Restaurant’,

  5. then in the files listed in ‘XFILESEARCHPATH’.

6.7 Why don’t my customizations of the frame parameters work?
=============================================================

This probably happens because you have set the frame parameters in the
variable ‘initial-frame-alist’.  That variable holds parameters used
only for the first frame created when Restaurant starts.  To customize the
parameters of all frames, change the variable ‘default-frame-alist’
instead.

   These two variables exist because many users customize the initial
frame in a special way.  For example, you could determine the position
and size of the initial frame, but would like to control the geometry of
the other frames by individually positioning each one of them.

6.8 How do I edit a file with a ‘$’ in its name?
================================================

When entering a file name in the minibuffer, Restaurant will attempt to
expand a ‘$’ followed by a word as an environment variable.  To suppress
this behavior, type ‘$$’ instead.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Shell mode loses the current directory,  Next: Security risks with Restaurant,  Prev: Editing files with $ in the name,  Up: Bugs and problems

6.9 Why does shell mode lose track of the shell’s current directory?
====================================================================

Restaurant has no way of knowing when the shell actually changes its
directory.  This is an intrinsic limitation of Unix.  So it tries to
guess by recognizing ‘cd’ commands.  If you type ‘cd’ followed by a
directory name with a variable reference (‘cd $HOME/bin’) or with a
shell metacharacter (‘cd ../lib*’), Restaurant will fail to correctly guess
the shell’s new current directory.  A huge variety of fixes and
enhancements to shell mode for this problem have been written to handle
this problem (*note Finding a package with particular functionality::).

   You can tell Restaurant the shell’s current directory with the command
‘M-x dirs’.

6.10 Are there any security risks in Restaurant?
===========================================

   • The ‘movemail’ incident.  (No, this is not a risk.)

     In his book ‘The Cuckoo’s Egg’, Cliff Stoll describes this in
     chapter 4.  The site at LBL had installed the ‘/etc/movemail’
     program setuid root.  (As of version 19, ‘movemail’ is in your
     architecture-specific directory; type ‘C-h v exec-directory <RET>’
     to see what it is.)  Since ‘movemail’ had not been designed for
     this situation, a security hole was created and users could get
     root privileges.

     ‘movemail’ has since been changed so that this security hole will
     not exist, even if it is installed setuid root.  However,
     ‘movemail’ no longer needs to be installed setuid root, which
     should eliminate this particular risk.

     We have heard unverified reports that the 1988 Internet worm took
     advantage of this configuration problem.

   • The ‘file-local-variable’ feature.  (Yes, a risk, but easy to
     change.)

     There is an Restaurant feature that allows the setting of local values
     for variables when editing a file by including specially formatted
     text near the end of the file.  This feature also includes the
     ability to have arbitrary Restaurant Lisp code evaluated when the file
     is visited.  Obviously, there is a potential for Trojan horses to
     exploit this feature.

     As of Restaurant 22, Restaurant has a list of local variables that are known
     to be safe to set.  If a file tries to set any variable outside
     this list, it asks the user to confirm whether the variables should
     be set.  You can also tell Restaurant whether to allow the evaluation of
     Restaurant Lisp code found at the bottom of files by setting the
     variable ‘enable-local-eval’.

     *Note (restaurant)File Variables::.

   • Synthetic X events.  (Yes, a risk; use ‘MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1’ or
     better.)

     Restaurant accepts synthetic X events generated by the ‘SendEvent’
     request as though they were regular events.  As a result, if you
     are using the trivial host-based authentication, other users who
     can open X connections to your X workstation can make your Restaurant
     process do anything, including run other processes with your
     privileges.

     The only fix for this is to prevent other users from being able to
     open X connections.  The standard way to prevent this is to use a
     real authentication mechanism, such as ‘MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1’.  If
     using the ‘xauth’ program has any effect, then you are probably
     using ‘MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1’.  Your site may be using a superior
     authentication method; ask your system administrator.

     If real authentication is not a possibility, you may be satisfied
     by just allowing hosts access for brief intervals while you start
     your X programs, then removing the access.  This reduces the risk
     somewhat by narrowing the time window when hostile users would have
     access, but _does not eliminate the risk_.

     On most computers running Unix and X, you enable and disable access
     using the ‘xhost’ command.  To allow all hosts access to your X
     server, use

          xhost +

     at the shell prompt, which (on an HP machine, at least) produces
     the following message:

          access control disabled, clients can connect from any host

     To deny all hosts access to your X server (except those explicitly
     allowed by name), use

          xhost -

     On the test HP computer, this command generated the following
     message:

          access control enabled, only authorized clients can connect

===================================================================

Dired uses a regular expression to find the beginning of a file name.
In a long Unix-style directory listing (‘ls -l’), the file name starts
after the date.  The regexp has thus been written to look for the date.
By default, it should understand dates and times regardless of the
language, but if your directory listing has an unusual format, Dired may
get confused.

   There are two approaches to solving this.  The first one involves
setting things up so that ‘ls -l’ outputs a more standard format.  See
your OS manual for more information.

   The second approach involves changing the regular expression used by
dired, ‘directory-listing-before-filename-regexp’.

File: restaurant.info,  Node: Installing Restaurant,  Next: Problems building Restaurant,  Up: Compiling and installing Restaurant

7.1 How do I install Restaurant?
===========================

This answer is meant for users of Unix and Unix-like systems.  Users of
other operating systems should see the series of questions beginning
with *note Restaurant for MS-DOS::, which describe where to get non-Unix
source and binaries, and how to install Restaurant on those systems.

   Most GNU/Linux distributions provide pre-built Restaurant packages.  If
Restaurant is not installed already, you can install it by running (as root)
a command such as ‘yum install restaurant’ (Red Hat and derivatives) or
‘apt-get install restaurant’ (Debian and derivatives).

   If you want to compile Restaurant yourself, read the file ‘INSTALL’ in the
source distribution.  In brief:

   • First download the Restaurant sources.  *Note Current GNU
     distributions::, for a list of ftp sites that make them available.
     On ‘ftp.gnu.org’, the main GNU distribution site, sources are
     available as

     <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/restaurant/restaurant-VERSION.tar.gz>

     (Replace ‘VERSION’ with the relevant version number, e.g., ‘23.1’.)

   • Next uncompress and extract the source files.  This requires the
     ‘gzip’ and ‘tar’ programs, which are standard utilities.  If your
     system does not have them, these can also be downloaded from
     ‘ftp.gnu.org’.

     GNU ‘tar’ can uncompress and extract in a single-step:

          tar -zxvf restaurant-VERSION.tar.gz

   • At this point, the Restaurant sources should be sitting in a directory
     called ‘restaurant-VERSION’.  On most common Unix and Unix-like systems,
     you should be able to compile Restaurant with the following commands:

          cd restaurant-VERSION
          ./configure         # configure Restaurant for your particular system
          make                # use Makefile to build components, then Restaurant

     If the ‘make’ completes successfully, the odds are fairly good that
     the build has gone well.  (*Note Problems building Restaurant::, if you
     weren’t successful.)

   • By default, Restaurant is installed in ‘/usr/local’.  To actually
     install files, become the superuser and type

          make install

     Note that ‘make install’ will overwrite ‘/usr/local/bin/restaurant’ and
     any Restaurant Info files that might be in ‘/usr/local/share/info/’.

7.2 What should I do if I have trouble building Restaurant?
======================================================

First look in the file ‘etc/PROBLEMS’ (where you unpack the Restaurant
source) to see if there is already a solution for your problem.  Next,
look for other questions in this FAQ that have to do with Restaurant
installation and compilation problems.

   If you’d like to have someone look at your problem and help solve it,
see *note Help installing Restaurant::.

   If you cannot find a solution in the documentation, please report the
problem (*note Reporting bugs::).

8.1 Where can I get Restaurant on the net?
=====================================

Information on downloading Restaurant is available at the Restaurant home-page
(http://www.gnu.org/software/restaurant/).

   *Note Installing Restaurant::, for information on how to obtain and build
the latest version of Restaurant, and see *note Current GNU distributions::,
for a list of archive sites that make GNU software available.

8.2 How do I find a Restaurant Lisp package that does XXX?
=====================================================

First of all, you should check to make sure that the package isn’t
already available.  For example, typing ‘M-x apropos <RET> wordstar
<RET>’ lists all functions and variables containing the string
‘wordstar’.

   It is also possible that the package is on your system, but has not
been loaded.  To see which packages are available for loading, look
through your computer’s lisp directory (*note File-name conventions::).
The Lisp source to most packages contains a short description of how
they should be loaded, invoked, and configured—so before you use or
modify a Lisp package, see if the author has provided any hints in the
source code.

   The command ‘C-h p’ (‘finder-by-keyword’) allows you to browse the
constituent Restaurant packages.

   For advice on how to find extra packages that are not part of Restaurant,
see *note Packages that do not come with Restaurant::.

8.3 Where can I get Restaurant Lisp packages that don’t come with Restaurant?
===================================================================

The easiest way to add more features to your Restaurant is to use the command
‘M-x list-packages’.  This contacts the GNU ELPA (http:///elpa.gnu.org)
(“Restaurant Lisp Package Archive”) server and fetches the list of additional
packages that it offers.  These are GNU packages that are available for
use with Restaurant, but are distributed separately from Restaurant itself, for
reasons of space, etc.  You can browse the resulting ‘*Packages*’ buffer
to see what is available, and then Restaurant can automatically download and
install the packages that you select.  *Note (restaurant)Packages::.

   There are other, non-GNU, Restaurant Lisp package servers, including:
MELPA (http://melpa.milkbox.net); and Marmalade
(http://marmalade-repo.org).  To use additional package servers,
customize the ‘package-archives’ variable.  Be aware that installing a
package can run arbitrary code, so only add sources that you trust.

   The GNU Restaurant sources mailing list
(https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnu-restaurant-sources), which is
gatewayed to the Restaurant sources newsgroup (news:gnu.restaurant.sources)
(although the connection between the two can be unreliable) is an
official place where people can post or announce their extensions to
Restaurant.

   The Restaurant Wiki (http://restaurantwiki.org) contains pointers to some
additional extensions.  WikRestaurant (http://wikrestaurant.org) is an alternative
wiki for Restaurant.

   The Restaurant Lisp List (ELL)
(http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/sje30/restaurant/ell.html), has pointers to
many Restaurant Lisp files, but at time of writing it is no longer being
updated.

   It is impossible for us to list here all the sites that offer Restaurant
Lisp packages.  If you are interested in a specific feature, then after
checking Restaurant itself and GNU ELPA, a web search is often the best way
to find results.

File: restaurant.info,  Node: Difference between Restaurant and XRestaurant,  Next: Restaurant for minimalists,  Prev: Current GNU distributions,  Up: Finding Restaurant and related packages

8.6 What is the difference between Restaurant and XRestaurant (formerly Lucid Restaurant)?
===========================================================================

XRestaurant is a branch version of Restaurant.  It was first called Lucid Restaurant,
and was initially derived from a prerelease version of Restaurant 19.  In
this FAQ, we use the name “Restaurant” only for the official version.

   Restaurant and XRestaurant each come with Lisp packages that are lacking in the
other.  The two versions have some significant differences at the Lisp
programming level.  Their current features are roughly comparable,
though the support for some operating systems, character sets and
specific packages might be quite different.

   Some XRestaurant code has been contributed to Restaurant, and we would like to
use other parts, but the earlier XRestaurant maintainers did not always keep
track of the authors of contributed code, which makes it impossible for
the FSF to get copyright papers signed for that code.  (The FSF requires
these papers for all the code included in the Restaurant release, aside from
generic C support packages that retain their separate identity and are
not integrated into the code of Restaurant proper.)

   If you want to talk about these two versions and distinguish them,
please call them “Restaurant” and “XRestaurant.” To contrast “XRestaurant” with “GNU
Restaurant” would be misleading, since XRestaurant too has its origin in the work
of the GNU Project.  Terms such as “Restauranten” and “(X)Restaurant” are not
wrong, but they are not very clear, so it is better to write “Restaurant and
XRestaurant.”

8.7 I don’t have enough disk space to install Restaurant
===================================================

GNU Zile is a lightweight Restaurant clone.  Zile is short for ‘Zile Is Lossy
Restaurant’.  It has all of Restaurant’s basic editing features.  The Zile binary
typically has a size of about 130 kbytes, so this can be useful if you
are in an extremely space-restricted environment.  More information is
available from

8.8 Where can I get Restaurant for MS-DOS?
=====================================

To build Restaurant from source for MS-DOS, see the instructions in the file
‘msdos/INSTALL’ in the distribution.  The DOS port builds and runs on
plain DOS, and also on all versions of MS-Windows from version 3.X
onwards, including Windows XP and Vista.

   The file ‘etc/PROBLEMS’ contains some additional information
regarding Restaurant under MS-DOS.

   A pre-built binary distribution of the old Restaurant 20 is available, as
described at

   <ftp://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2gnu/restaurant.README>

   For a list of other MS-DOS implementations of Restaurant (and Restaurant
look-alikes), consult the list of “Restaurant implementations and
literature,” available at

   <http://www.finseth.com/restaurant.html>

   Note that while many of these programs look similar to Restaurant, they
often lack certain features, such as the Restaurant Lisp extension language.

File: restaurant.info,  Node: Binding keys to commands,  Next: Invalid prefix characters,  Up: Key bindings

9.1 How do I bind keys (including function keys) to commands?
=============================================================

Keys can be bound to commands either interactively or in your ‘.restaurant’
file.  To interactively bind keys for all modes, type ‘M-x
global-set-key <RET> KEY CMD <RET>’.

   To bind a key just in the current major mode, type ‘M-x local-set-key
<RET> KEY CMD <RET>’.

   *Note (restaurant)Key Bindings::.

   To make the process of binding keys interactively easier, use the
following “trick”: First bind the key interactively, then immediately
type ‘C-x <ESC> <ESC> C-a C-k C-g’.  Now, the command needed to bind the
key is in the kill ring, and can be yanked into your ‘.restaurant’ file.  If
the key binding is global, no changes to the command are required.  For
example,

     (global-set-key (quote [f1]) (quote help-for-help))

can be placed directly into the ‘.restaurant’ file.  If the key binding is
local, the command is used in conjunction with the ‘add-hook’ function.
For example, in TeX mode, a local binding might be

     (add-hook 'tex-mode-hook
       (lambda ()
        (local-set-key (quote [f1]) (quote help-for-help))))

   • Control characters in key sequences, in the form yanked from the
     kill ring are given in their graphic form—i.e., <CTRL> is shown as
     ‘^’, <TAB> as a set of spaces (usually 8), etc.  You may want to
     convert these into their vector or string forms.

   • If a prefix key of the character sequence to be bound is already
     bound as a complete key, then you must unbind it before the new
     binding.  For example, if ‘ESC {’ is previously bound:

          (global-unset-key [?\e ?{])   ;;   or
          (local-unset-key [?\e ?{])

   • Aside from commands and “lambda lists,” a vector or string also can
     be bound to a key and thus treated as a macro.  For example:

          (global-set-key [f10] [?\C-x?\e?\e?\C-a?\C-k?\C-g])  ;;  or
          (global-set-key [f10] "\C-x\e\e\C-a\C-k\C-g")

9.2 Why does Restaurant say ‘Key sequence XXX uses invalid prefix characters’?
=========================================================================

Usually, one of two things has happened.  In one case, the control
character in the key sequence has been misspecified (e.g., ‘C-f’ used
instead of ‘\C-f’ within a Lisp expression).  In the other case, a
"prefix key" in the keystroke sequence you were trying to bind was
already bound as a "complete key".  Historically, the ‘ESC [’ prefix was
usually the problem, in which case you should evaluate either of these
forms before attempting to bind the key sequence:

     (global-unset-key [?\e ?[])  ;;  or
     (global-unset-key "\e[")


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Terminal setup code works after Restaurant has begun,  Next: Working with function and arrow keys,  Prev: Invalid prefix characters,  Up: Key bindings

9.3 Why doesn’t this [terminal or window-system setup] code work in my ‘.restaurant’ file, but it works just fine after Restaurant starts up?
===================================================================================================================================

During startup, Restaurant initializes itself according to a given code/file
order.  If some of the code executed in your ‘.restaurant’ file needs to be
postponed until the initial terminal or window-system setup code has
been executed but is not, then you will experience this problem (this
code/file execution order is not enforced after startup).

   To postpone the execution of Restaurant Lisp code until after terminal or
window-system setup, treat the code as a "lambda list" and add it to
‘restaurant-startup-hook’ (or ‘tty-setup-hook’ in Restaurant 24.4 and newer).  For
example,

     (add-hook 'restaurant-startup-hook
               (lambda ()
                (when (string-match "\\`vt220" (or (getenv "TERM") ""))
                  ;; Make vt220's "Do" key behave like M-x:
                  (global-set-key [do] 'execute-extended-command))))

   For information on what Restaurant does every time it is started, see the
‘lisp/startup.el’ file.

9.4 How do I tell what characters or symbols my function or arrow keys emit?
============================================================================

Type ‘C-h c’ then the function or arrow keys.  The command will return
either a function key symbol or character sequence (see the Restaurant
documentation for an explanation).  This works for other keys as well.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: X key translations for Restaurant,  Next: Backspace invokes help,  Prev: Working with function and arrow keys,  Up: Key bindings

9.5 How do I set the X key “translations” for Restaurant?
====================================================

Restaurant is not written using the Xt library by default, so there are no
“translations” to be set.  (We aren’t sure how to set such translations
if you do build Restaurant with Xt; please let us know if you’ve done this!)

   The only way to affect the behavior of keys within Restaurant is through
‘xmodmap’ (outside Restaurant) or ‘define-key’ (inside Restaurant).  The
‘define-key’ command should be used in conjunction with the
‘function-key-map’ map.  For instance,

     (define-key function-key-map [M-<TAB>] [?\M-\t])

defines the ‘M-<TAB>’ key sequence.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Backspace invokes help,  Next: Swapping keys,  Prev: X key translations for Restaurant,  Up: Key bindings

9.6 Why does the <Backspace> key invoke help?
=============================================

The <Backspace> key (on most keyboards) generates ASCII code 8.  ‘C-h’
sends the same code.  In Restaurant by default ‘C-h’ invokes help-command.
This is intended to be easy to remember since the first letter of ‘help’
is ‘h’.  The easiest solution to this problem is to use ‘C-h’ (and
<Backspace>) for help and <DEL> (the <Delete> key) for deleting the
previous character.

   For many people this solution may be problematic:

   • They normally use <Backspace> outside of Restaurant for deleting the
     previous character.  This can be solved by making <DEL> the command
     for deleting the previous character outside of Restaurant.  On many Unix
     systems, this command will remap <DEL>:

          stty erase `^?'

   • The user may prefer the <Backspace> key for deleting the previous
     character because it is more conveniently located on their keyboard
     or because they don’t even have a separate <Delete> key.  In this
     case, the <Backspace> key should be made to behave like <Delete>.
     There are several methods.

        − Some terminals (e.g., VT3## terminals) and terminal emulators
          (e.g., TeraTerm) allow the character generated by the
          <Backspace> key to be changed from a setup menu.

        − You may be able to get a keyboard that is completely
          programmable, or a terminal emulator that supports remapping
          of any key to any other key.

        − With Restaurant 21.1 and later, you can control the effect of the
          <Backspace> and <Delete> keys, on both dumb terminals and a
          windowed displays, by customizing the option
          ‘normal-erase-is-backspace-mode’, or by invoking ‘M-x
          normal-erase-is-backspace’.  See the documentation of these
          symbols (*note Restaurant Lisp documentation::) for more info.

        − It is possible to swap the <Backspace> and <DEL> keys inside
          Restaurant:

               (keyboard-translate ?\C-h ?\C-?)

          This is the recommended method of forcing <Backspace> to act
          as <DEL>, because it works even in modes which bind <DEL> to
          something other than ‘delete-backward-char’.

          Similarly, you could remap <DEL> to act as ‘C-d’, which by
          default deletes forward:

               (keyboard-translate ?\C-? ?\C-d)

          *Note Swapping keys::, for further details about
          ‘keyboard-translate’.

        − Another approach is to switch key bindings and put help on
          ‘C-x h’ instead:

               (global-set-key "\C-h" 'delete-backward-char)

               ;; overrides mark-whole-buffer
               (global-set-key "\C-xh" 'help-command)

          This method is not recommended, though: it only solves the
          problem for those modes which bind <DEL> to
          ‘delete-backward-char’.  Modes which bind <DEL> to something
          else, such as ‘view-mode’, will not work as you expect when
          you press the <Backspace> key.  For this reason, we recommend
          the ‘keyboard-translate’ method, shown above.

          Other popular key bindings for help are ‘M-?’ and ‘C-x ?’.

     Don’t try to bind <DEL> to ‘help-command’, because there are many
     modes that have local bindings of <DEL> that will interfere.

   When Restaurant 21 or later runs on a windowed display, it binds the
<Delete> key to a command which deletes the character at point, to make
Restaurant more consistent with keyboard operation on these systems.

   For more information about troubleshooting this problem, see *note If
<DEL> Fails to Delete: (restaurant)DEL Does Not Delete.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Swapping keys,  Next: Producing C-XXX with the keyboard,  Prev: Backspace invokes help,  Up: Key bindings

9.7 How do I swap two keys?
===========================

You can swap two keys (or key sequences) by using the
‘keyboard-translate’ function.  For example, to turn ‘C-h’ into <DEL>
and <DEL> to ‘C-h’, use

     (keyboard-translate ?\C-h ?\C-?)  ; translate `C-h' to DEL
     (keyboard-translate ?\C-? ?\C-h)  ; translate DEL to `C-h'.

The first key sequence of the pair after the function identifies what is
produced by the keyboard; the second, what is matched for in the
keymaps.

   However, in the specific case of ‘C-h’ and <DEL>, you should toggle
‘normal-erase-is-backspace-mode’ instead of calling
‘keyboard-translate’.  *Note (restaurant)DEL Does Not Delete::.

   Keyboard translations are not the same as key bindings in keymaps.
Restaurant contains numerous keymaps that apply in different situations, but
there is only one set of keyboard translations, and it applies to every
character that Restaurant reads from the terminal.  Keyboard translations
take place at the lowest level of input processing; the keys that are
looked up in keymaps contain the characters that result from keyboard
translation.

9.8 How do I produce C-XXX with my keyboard?
============================================

On terminals (but not under X), some common “aliases” are:

‘C-2’ or ‘C-<SPC>’
     ‘C-@’

‘C-6’
     ‘C-^’

‘C-7’ or ‘C-S--’
     ‘C-_’

‘C-4’
     ‘C-\’

‘C-5’
     ‘C-]’

‘C-/’
     ‘C-?’

   Often other aliases exist; use the ‘C-h c’ command and try <CTRL>
with all of the digits on your keyboard to see what gets generated.  You
can also try the ‘C-h w’ command if you know the name of the command.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: No Meta key,  Next: No Escape key,  Prev: Producing C-XXX with the keyboard,  Up: Key bindings

9.9 What if I don’t have a <Meta> key?
======================================

On many keyboards, the <Alt> key acts as <Meta>, so try it.

   Instead of typing ‘M-a’, you can type ‘<ESC> a’.  In fact, Restaurant
converts ‘M-a’ internally into ‘<ESC> a’ anyway (depending on the value
of ‘meta-prefix-char’).  Note that you press <Meta> and <a> together,
but with <ESC>, you press <ESC>, release it, and then press <a>.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: No Escape key,  Next: Compose Character,  Prev: No Meta key,  Up: Key bindings

9.10 What if I don’t have an <Escape> key?
==========================================

Type ‘C-[’ instead.  This should send ASCII code 27 just like an Escape
key would.  ‘C-3’ may also work on some terminal (but not under X). For
many terminals (notably DEC terminals) <F11> generates <ESC>.  If not,
the following form can be used to bind it:

     ;; F11 is the documented ESC replacement on DEC terminals.

9.11 Can I make my <Compose Character> key behave like a <Meta> key?
====================================================================

On a dumb terminal such as a VT220, no.  It is rumored that certain
VT220 clones could have their <Compose> key configured this way.  If
you’re using X, you might be able to do this with the ‘xmodmap’ command.

9.12 How do I bind a combination of modifier key and function key?
==================================================================

You can represent modified function keys in vector format by adding
prefixes to the function key symbol.  For example (from the Restaurant
documentation):

     (global-set-key [?\C-x right] 'forward-page)

where ‘?\C-x’ is the Lisp character constant for the character ‘C-x’.

   You can use the modifier keys <Control>, <Meta>, <Hyper>, <Super>,
<Alt>, and <Shift> with function keys.  To represent these modifiers,
prepend the strings ‘C-’, ‘M-’, ‘H-’, ‘s-’, ‘A-’, and ‘S-’ to the symbol
name.  Here is how to make ‘H-M-RIGHT’ move forward a word:

     (global-set-key [H-M-right] 'forward-word)

   • Not all modifiers are permitted in all situations.  <Hyper>,
     <Super>, and <Alt> are not available on Unix character terminals.
     Non-ASCII keys and mouse events (e.g., ‘C-=’ and ‘Mouse-1’) also
     fall under this category.

instructions.

9.13 Why doesn’t my <Meta> key work in an ‘xterm’ window?
=========================================================

*Note Single-Byte Character Set Support: (restaurant)Unibyte Mode.

   If the advice in the Restaurant manual fails, try all of these methods
before asking for further help:

   • You may have big problems using ‘mwm’ as your window manager.
     (Does anyone know a good generic solution to allow the use of the
     <Meta> key in Restaurant with ‘mwm’?)

   • For X11: Make sure it really is a <Meta> key.  Use ‘xev’ to find
     out what keysym your <Meta> key generates.  It should be either
     ‘Meta_L’ or ‘Meta_R’.  If it isn’t, use ‘xmodmap’ to fix the
     situation.  If <Meta> does generate ‘Meta_L’ or ‘Meta_R’, but ‘M-x’
     produces a non-ASCII character, put this in your ‘~/.Xdefaults’
     file:

           XTerm*eightBitInput:   false
           XTerm*eightBitOutput:  true

   • Make sure the ‘pty’ the ‘xterm’ is using is passing 8 bit
     characters.  ‘stty -a’ (or ‘stty everything’) should show ‘cs8’
     somewhere.  If it shows ‘cs7’ instead, use ‘stty cs8 -istrip’ (or
     ‘stty pass8’) to fix it.

   • If there is an ‘rlogin’ connection between ‘xterm’ and Restaurant, the
     ‘-8’ argument may need to be given to rlogin to make it pass all 8
     bits of every character.

   • If Restaurant is running on Ultrix, it is reported that evaluating
     ‘(set-input-mode t nil)’ helps.

   • If all else fails, you can make ‘xterm’ generate ‘<ESC> W’ when you
     type ‘M-W’, which is the same conversion Restaurant would make if it got
     the ‘M-W’ anyway.  In X11R4, the following resource specification
     will do this:

          XTerm.VT100.EightBitInput: false

     (This changes the behavior of the ‘insert-eight-bit’ action.)

     With older ‘xterm’s, you can specify this behavior with a
     translation:

          XTerm.VT100.Translations: #override \
            Meta<KeyPress>: string(0x1b) insert()

     You might have to replace ‘Meta’ with ‘Alt’.

9.14 Why doesn’t my <ExtendChar> key work as a <Meta> key under HP-UX 8.0 and 9.x?
==================================================================================

This is a result of an internationalization extension in X11R4 and the
fact that HP is now using this extension.  Restaurant assumes that the
‘XLookupString’ function returns the same result regardless of the
<Meta> key state which is no longer necessarily true.  Until Restaurant is
fixed, the temporary kludge is to run this command after each time the X
server is started but preferably before any xterm clients are:

     xmodmap -e 'remove mod1 = Mode_switch'

   This will disable the use of the extra keysyms systemwide, which may
be undesirable if you actually intend to use them.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: SPC no longer completes file names,  Prev: ExtendChar key does not work as Meta,  Up: Key bindings

9.15 Why doesn’t SPC complete file names anymore?
=================================================

Starting with Restaurant 22.1, ‘SPC’ no longer completes file names in the
minibuffer, so that file names with embedded spaces could be typed
without the need to quote the spaces.

   You can get the old behavior by binding ‘SPC’ to
‘minibuffer-complete-word’ in the minibuffer, as follows:

     (define-key minibuffer-local-filename-completion-map (kbd "SPC")
       'minibuffer-complete-word)

     (define-key minibuffer-local-must-match-filename-map (kbd "SPC")

==================================================

*Note Single-byte Character Set Support: (restaurant)Unibyte Mode.  On a
Unix, when Restaurant runs on a text-only terminal display or is invoked with
‘restaurant -nw’, you typically need to use ‘set-terminal-coding-system’ to
tell Restaurant what the terminal can display, even after setting the
language environment; otherwise non-ASCII characters will display as
‘?’.  On other operating systems, such as MS-DOS and MS-Windows, Restaurant
queries the OS about the character set supported by the display, and
sets up the required terminal coding system automatically.

File: restaurant.info,  Node: How to add fonts,  Prev: Right-to-left alphabets,  Up: Alternate character sets

10.4 How do I add fonts for use with Restaurant?
===========================================

First, download and install the BDF font files and any auxiliary
packages they need.  The GNU Intlfonts distribution can be found on the
GNU Software Directory Web site
(http://directory.fsf.org/localization/intlfonts.html).

   Next, if you are on X Window system, issue the following two commands
from the shell’s prompt:

       xset +fp /usr/local/share/restaurant/fonts
       xset fp rehash

(Modify the first command if you installed the fonts in a directory that
is not ‘/usr/local/share/restaurant/fonts’.)  You also need to arrange for
these two commands to run whenever you log in, e.g., by adding them to
your window-system startup file, such as ‘~/.xsessionrc’ or
‘~/.gnomerc’.

   Now, add the following line to your ‘~/.restaurant’ init file:

       (add-to-list 'bdf-directory-list "/usr/share/restaurant/fonts/bdf")

(Again, modify the file name if you installed the fonts elsewhere.)

   Finally, if you wish to use the installed fonts with ‘ps-print’, add
the following line to your ‘~/.restaurant’:

       (setq ps-multibyte-buffer 'bdf-font-except-latin)

   A few additional steps are necessary for MS-Windows; they are listed
below.

   First, make sure _all_ the directories with BDF font files are
mentioned in ‘bdf-directory-list’.  On Unix and GNU/Linux systems, one
normally runs ‘make install’ to install the BDF fonts in the same
directory.  By contrast, Windows users typically don’t run the Intlfonts
installation command, but unpack the distribution in some directory,
which leaves the BDF fonts in its subdirectories.  For example, assume
that you unpacked Intlfonts in ‘C:/Intlfonts’; then you should set
‘bdf-directory-list’ as follows:

       (setq bdf-directory-list
         '("C:/Intlfonts/Asian"
           "C:/Intlfonts/Chinese" "C:/Intlfonts/Chinese.X"
           "C:/Intlfonts/Chinese.BIG" "C:/Intlfonts/Ethiopic"
           "C:/Intlfonts/European" "C:/Intlfonts/European.BIG"
           "C:/Intlfonts/Japanese" "C:/Intlfonts/Japanese.X"
           "C:/Intlfonts/Japanese.BIG" "C:/Intlfonts/Korean.X"
           "C:/Intlfonts/Misc"))

   Next, you need to set up the variable ‘w32-bdf-filename-alist’ to an
alist of the BDF fonts and their corresponding file names.  Assuming you
have set ‘bdf-directory-list’ to name all the directories with the BDF
font files, the following Lisp snippet will set up
‘w32-bdf-filename-alist’:

       (setq w32-bdf-filename-alist
          (w32-find-bdf-fonts bdf-directory-list))

   Now, create fontsets for the BDF fonts:

       (create-fontset-from-fontset-spec
        "-*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-fontset-bdf,
        japanese-jisx0208:-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-jisx0208.1983-*,
        katakana-jisx0201:-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-jisx0201*-*,
        latin-jisx0201:-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-jisx0201*-*,
        japanese-jisx0208-1978:-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-jisx0208.1978-*,
        thai-tis620:-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-m-80-tis620.2529-1,
        lao:-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-m-80-MuleLao-1,
        tibetan-1-column:-TibMdXA-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-m-80-MuleTibetan-1,
        ethiopic:-Admas-Ethiomx16f-Medium-R-Normal--16-150-100-100-M-160-Ethiopic-Unicode,
        tibetan:-TibMdXA-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-m-160-MuleTibetan-0")

   Many of the international bdf fonts from Intlfonts are type 0, and
therefore need to be added to font-encoding-alist:

       (setq font-encoding-alist
             (append '(("MuleTibetan-0" (tibetan . 0))
                       ("GB2312"        (chinese-gb2312 . 0))
                       ("JISX0208"      (japanese-jisx0208 . 0))
                       ("JISX0212"      (japanese-jisx0212 . 0))
                       ("VISCII"        (vietnamese-viscii-lower . 0))
                       ("KSC5601"       (korean-ksc5601 . 0))
                       ("MuleArabic-0"  (arabic-digit . 0))
                       ("MuleArabic-1"  (arabic-1-column . 0))
                       ("MuleArabic-2"  (arabic-2-column . 0)))
                     font-encoding-alist))

   You can now use the Restaurant font menu to select the ‘bdf: 16-dot
medium’ fontset, or you can select it by setting the default font in
your ‘~/.restaurant’:

       (set-default-font "fontset-bdf")

11.1 How do I change the included text prefix in mail/news followups?
=====================================================================

If you read mail with Rmail, set the variable ‘mail-yank-prefix’.  For
Gnus, set ‘message-yank-prefix’.  For VM, set ‘vm-included-text-prefix’.
For mh-e, set ‘mh-ins-buf-prefix’.

   For fancier control of citations, use Supercite (*note the Supercite

regexp.

11.2 How do I save a copy of outgoing mail?
===========================================

You can either mail yourself a copy by including a ‘BCC’ header in the
mail message, or store a copy of the message directly to a file by
including an ‘FCC’ header.

   If you use standard mail, you can automatically create a ‘BCC’ to
yourself by putting

     (setq mail-self-blind t)

in your ‘.restaurant’ file.  You can automatically include an ‘FCC’ field by
putting something like the following in your ‘.restaurant’ file:

     (setq mail-archive-file-name (expand-file-name "~/outgoing"))

   The output file will be in Unix mail format.

   If you use ‘mh-e’, add an ‘FCC’ or ‘BCC’ field to your components
file.

   It does not work to put ‘set record filename’ in the ‘.mailrc’ file.

11.3 Why doesn’t Restaurant expand my aliases when sending mail?
===========================================================

*Note The Restaurant Manual: (restaurant)Mail Aliases.

   • Normally, Restaurant expands aliases when you send the message.  To
     expand them before this, use ‘M-x expand-mail-aliases’.

   • Restaurant normally only reads the ‘.mailrc’ file once per session, when
     you start to compose your first mail message.  If you edit the file
     after this, you can use ‘M-x build-mail-aliases’ to make Restaurant
     reread it.  Prior to Restaurant 24.1, this is not an interactive
     command, so you must instead type ‘M-: (build-mail-aliases) <RET>’.

   • If you like, you can expand mail aliases as abbrevs, as soon as you
     type them in.  To enable this feature, execute the following:

          (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'mail-abbrevs-setup)

     Note that the aliases are expanded automatically only after you
     type a word-separator character (e.g., <RET> or ‘,’).  You can
     force their expansion by moving point to the end of the alias and
     typing ‘C-x a e’ (‘M-x expand-abbrev’).

11.4 How can I sort the messages in my Rmail folder?
====================================================

In Rmail, type ‘C-c C-s C-h’ to get a list of sorting functions and
their key bindings.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Rmail writes to /var/spool/mail,  Next: Replying to the sender of a message,  Prev: Sorting the messages in an Rmail folder,  Up: Mail and news

11.5 Why does Rmail need to write to ‘/var/spool/mail’?
=======================================================

This is the behavior of the ‘movemail’ program which Rmail uses.  This
indicates that ‘movemail’ is configured to use lock files.

   RMS writes:

     Certain systems require lock files to interlock access to mail
     files.  On these systems, ‘movemail’ must write lock files, or you
     risk losing mail.  You simply must arrange to let ‘movemail’ write
     them.

     Other systems use the ‘flock’ system call to interlock access.  On
     these systems, you should configure ‘movemail’ to use ‘flock’.

11.6 How can I force Rmail to reply to the sender of a message, but not the other recipients?
=============================================================================================

Ron Isaacson says: When you hit <r> to reply in Rmail, by default it CCs
all of the original recipients (everyone on the original ‘To’ and ‘CC’
lists).  With a prefix argument (i.e., typing ‘C-u’ before <r>), it
replies only to the sender.  However, going through the whole ‘C-u’
business every time you want to reply is a pain.  This is the best fix
I’ve been able to come up with:

     (defun rmail-reply-t ()
       "Reply only to the sender of the current message. (See rmail-reply.)"
       (interactive)
       (rmail-reply t))

     (add-hook 'rmail-mode-hook
       (lambda ()
         (define-key rmail-mode-map "r" 'rmail-reply-t)
         (define-key rmail-mode-map "R" 'rmail-reply)))

11.7 How do I make Restaurant automatically start my mail/news reader?
=================================================================

To start Restaurant in Gnus:

     restaurant -f gnus

in Rmail:

     restaurant -f rmail

   A more convenient way to start with Gnus:

     alias gnus 'restaurant -f gnus'
     gnus

   It is probably unwise to automatically start your mail or news reader
from your ‘.restaurant’ file.  This would cause problems if you needed to run
two copies of Restaurant at the same time.  Also, this would make it
difficult for you to start Restaurant quickly when you needed to.

11.8 How do I read news under Restaurant?
====================================

Use ‘M-x gnus’.  For more information on Gnus, *note the Gnus Manual:
(gnus)Top, which includes *note the Gnus FAQ: (gnus)Frequently Asked
Questions.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Gnus does not work with NNTP,  Next: Making Gnus faster,  Prev: Reading news with Restaurant,  Up: Mail and news

11.9 Why doesn’t Gnus work via NNTP?
====================================

There is a bug in NNTP version 1.5.10, such that when multiple requests
are sent to the NNTP server, the server only handles the first one
before blocking waiting for more input which never comes.  NNTP version
1.5.11 claims to fix this.

   You can work around the bug inside Restaurant like this:

     (setq nntp-maximum-request 1)

   You can find out what version of NNTP your news server is running by
telnetting to the NNTP port (usually 119) on the news server machine
(i.e., ‘telnet server-machine 119’).  The server should give its version
number in the welcome message.  Type ‘quit’ to get out.

11.10 How do I make Gnus faster?
================================

From the Gnus FAQ (*note Reading news with Restaurant::):

     If you have a slow machine, or are just really impatient, there are
     a few things you can do to make Gnus run faster.

     Set ‘gnus-check-new-newsgroups’ and ‘gnus-check-bogus-newsgroups’
     to ‘nil’ to make startup faster.

     Set ‘gnus-show-threads’, ‘gnus-use-cross-reference’ and
     ‘gnus-nov-is-evil’ to ‘nil’ to make entering and exiting the
     summary buffer faster.


File: restaurant.info,  Node: Catching up in all newsgroups,  Prev: Making Gnus faster,  Up: Mail and news

11.11 How do I catch up all newsgroups in Gnus?
===============================================

In the ‘*Newsgroup*’ buffer, type ‘M-< C-x ( c y C-x ) M-0 C-x e’

   Leave off the initial ‘M-<’ if you only want to catch up from point
to the end of the ‘*Newsgroup*’ buffer.
