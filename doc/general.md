## What is Restaurant IDE

There is no specialized Chef IDE for DevOps for free usage (there is editors, there is RubyMine with chef plugin, but only for non-commercial usage). So, Restaurant is the project of ready-to-use chef IDE.

Files and folders:
rc.local.el - your local changes
rc.custom.el - your custom changes via GUI
