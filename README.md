# Restaurant

## What is Restaurant IDE and Why (just another IDE?).

**Restaurant** software is an Integrated Development Environment for Chef developers.

### Objectives

Also, Restaurant supports tools `rvm`, `bundler`, `berkshelf` (via built-in extensions to this tools), `git` and `github` integrations, *yaml*, *json* and *markdown* file tools (like, reformatting, visualising etc).
